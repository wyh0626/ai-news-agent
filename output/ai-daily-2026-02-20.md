### 1. Orchestration Design Emerges as Key Optimization Target for LLMs

Orchestration design is emerging as a key optimization target as LLMs from multiple providers converge on benchmark performance. The paper formalizes a task-adaptive multi-agent framework that selects among parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid topologies, introduces a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, and presents a Topology Routing Algorithm with O(|V|+|E|) complexity, delivering 12-23% improvements over static baselines with identical models.

### 2. Anthropic Finds AI Agents Ask for Help More Than We Intervene

Anthropic analyzed Claude Code and its public API to measure agent autonomy in practice. The study finds agents run longer sessions and receive more actions auto-approved, but Claude Code asks for clarification more than twice as often as humans intervene; safety metrics remain reassuring with 80% of tool calls safeguarded and only 0.8% irreversible actions.

### 3. Claude Code Adds Built-in Git Worktree Support

Claude Code now includes built-in git worktree support to enable multiple agents to run concurrently without interference. The feature extends to the CLI alongside existing desktop support, enhancing parallel development workflows. [Source-x](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2025007393290272904)
