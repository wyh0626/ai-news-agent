### 1. Claude Opus 4.6: 14.5h 50% horizon on software tasks
METR_Evals reports Claude Opus 4.6 has a ~14.5-hour 50% time horizon for software tasks, with a 95% CI of 6 to 98 hours. The estimate is the highest yet but is very noisy due to a nearly saturated task suite. This highlights the challenges of long-horizon task evaluation and the volatility of performance estimates at scale. [Source-x](https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/2024926393965183472)

### 2. obra's Superpowers: Agentic AI Coding Framework and Workflow
Superpowers is an open-source software development workflow for coding agents built on composable "skills" and guiding initial instructions. It prompts users to elicit a spec, presents a digestible design, and then produces an implementation plan aligned with red/green TDD, YAGNI, and DRY, relying on subagent-driven execution. The project is hosted on GitHub. [Source-github](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
