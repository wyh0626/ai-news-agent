Cosmic Waste of Time.
Those who understood anything at all, wasted it on fretting about obscure degenerate cases in decision theory. The rest were willfully blind. Literally Marxists had insight incomparable to our sorry generation.

It was very polite of Hanson to call this the dreamtime. What we are in is the cope time, we have spent the preceding decades consoling ourselves about the obvious convergence point of history by replacing the place where neither liberty or stories exist with slop like Star Trek.

Seems like a lot of people are taking this as gospel—when we say the measurement is extremely noisy, we really mean it.

Concretely, if the task distribution we're using here was just a tiny bit different, we could've measured a time horizon of 8 hours, or 20 hours.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

Sometimes OpenAI & Anthropic's coding models are eerily similar in their oversights and misconceptions. But there are many situations where one has an important insight, sees an issue where the other simply doesn't. Lately, I've been finding it very useful to drive my primary coding with Claude code and then have multi-turn discussion on major decisions, or one shot reviews with Codex via a skill.

Now, agents can run in parallel without interfering with one other. Each agent gets its own worktree and can work independently.

The Claude Code Desktop app has had built-in support for worktrees for a while, and now we're bringing it to CLI too.

OpenAI spends \*vastly\* more on training than on inference. All of their public models released in 2025 couldn't have possibly cost more than ≈$1.5B in training. Concerning.

TLDR
Revenue:
— OpenAI bumped its 5-year revenue forecast up by ~27%.
— Last year’s revenue tripled to $13.1B (beating projections by $100M).
— New targets: $30B this year, $62B next year.
— Consumer sales should double to $17B this year and hit $150B by 2030 (>50% of total revenue).
— "New products" (including hardware) will bring in $1.3B next year. Still TBD on what else is in this bucket.

Cash Burn & Compute:
— Burn through 2030 will be 2x previous estimates. Infrastructure & compute alone will cost a massive $665B.
— Total spend: $25B this year, $57B next year (a $30B increase from older forecasts).
— Inference costs: ~$8B last year (with
4.5B going to inference for paid users). Scaling to ~$14B this year and $26B next year (cc [@EpochAIResearch](https://nitter.net/EpochAIResearch "Epoch AI") don't miss this out).
— Training costs: $8.3B last year. Rocketing to $32B this year and $65B next year. Total training spend through 2030 is nearly $440B

Margins:
— Gross margins missed targets last year because higher-than-expected demand forced OpenAI to buy pricey last-minute compute.
— Adjusted gross margin (revenue minus inference) fell from 40% to 33%, missing their 46% target for 2025.
— They still expect to be cash-flow positive by 2030, and ended 2025 with ~$40B in cash in the bank

Growth:
— ChatGPT just hit a new peak: 910M WAU
— Execs noted that growth actually slowed down earlier this fall...
— ...but the recent GPT-5.1 and 5.2 updates (which made the model much more "human-like") re-sparked user growth. The long-term goal is 2.75B WAUs by 2030.

At the current rate, AI's recursive self-improvement is mainly limited by two factors: compute and humans.

We have summoned an extremely powerful creature. If let loose, it would grow much faster than whatever we can do to tame it.

Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws over the weekend. The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)

I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.

Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.

Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.

Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.

\## the egocentric fallacy: "the most important part of a trend will happen to be right now when i randomly decide to care a lot about it because of some dude's post"

just to punch strawmen with Han (whom i love), this meta-principle of "choose the laggards in hopes they catch up" is a noob mistake and has a lower chance of working than most people are trained to appreciate (because they fundamentally want to believe in equality when capitalism fundamentally does not).

generation after generation of investors from Thiel to [@Chamath](https://nitter.net/Chamath "Chamath Palihapitiya") have learned painful lessons to double down on winners rather than do relative value trades.

a simple thought exercise is to ask if the Software Engineering number goes up to 80% or 90% in the next 5 years would you be better of working on Back Office Automation? (no, the answer is no, some folks are so capitalism illiterate you need that to be spelled out) . So then if we just zoomed from 10 to 50% in the last 2 years, it is actually a classic egotistical fallacy that this exact moment is when AI x SWE peaked and it's all relative downside from here vs other domains, which is what is implied by the chart below: who are you, who are we, what evidence do you have, to say we are anywhere even close to done on the largest product market fit we've seen in software business history?

[@nlw](https://nitter.net/nlw "Nathaniel Whittemore") has been echoing my thoughts here - kode is the lions share of agi and basically by betting on anything else you may well be rich and you may well be happier and you may well have much more positive social impact on the world.... but do not confuse that for having higher expected value.

This should be a given. Although there are definitely cases you could want to do some ops on CPU if you have crap load of multiprocessing. The real trick is to transfer between GPU and CPU in low precision

Here's a neural net optimization trick that leads to ~4x faster CPU to GPU transfers.

Imagine an image classification task.

\- We define the network, load the data and transform it.
\- In the training loop, we transfer the data to the GPU and train.

Here's the problem with this:

If you look at the profiler:
\- Most of the time/resources will be allocated to the kernel (the actual training code).
\- However, a significant amount of time will also be dedicated to data transfer from CPU to GPU (this appears under cudaMemcpyAsync).

Reducing the data transfer is simple.

Recall that the original dataset was composed of pixel values. These were 8-bit integers, and we transformed them to 32-bit floats.

Next, we transferred these 32-bit floating-point tensors to the GPU. This meant that transforming the data led to more data (4x) being transferred.

The solution is simple.

Moving the transformation step after the data transfer, since in that case, we shall transfer 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats.

As a result, you will notice a significant drop in the data transfer step.

Of course, this technique doesn’t apply to all neural network use cases, like NLP, where we inherently deal with 32-bit float embeddings.

However, whenever I have identified any possibility to use this trick, I have experienced noticeable gains from it.

👉 Over to you: What other NN optimization techniques are you aware of?

Last time I freaked out … this time I am not freaking out for a few reasons, main one is that this is expected when you automate economically valuable tasks.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

Freaking out is mainly due to predictions mismatching expectations. If you start thinking about predictions carefully, this is the expected outcome.

It's also funny how by this account the US is actually doing well in terms of isolating China. Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Kyrghyzstan, Tajikistan, North Korea (???) moved towards the US. Those have borders with China. Cambodia, Thailand: no land borders.

Updated results on ARC AGI 2 ( [@arcprize](https://nitter.net/arcprize "ARC Prize") )

Ran my January 27th attempt on Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview by [@GoogleDeepMind](https://nitter.net/GoogleDeepMind "Google DeepMind")

Achieved 94.1% at $ 8.71/task. (reasoning set to high in OpenRouter)

Some key differences I noticed vs Claude Opus 4.6

\- Cheaper and uses less tokens overall.
\- Doesn't really abide by tool\_calling and tends to respond with text even when prompted to call tools in sequences.
\- API runs into errors when the model can't trace back on the reasoning trace (retry logic in code handles it)
\- No regressions vs opus! Gemini 3.1 Pro solved 11 tasks that were unsolved previously

Overall, the tool output traces show very deep understanding and ability to use code execution sandbox to understand when its approach is failing and update hypothesis.

btw if the new 99.1 day doubling time holds, this would imply ~144 hour or 6 day time horizons by end of year

with the pre-Opus-4.6 doubling time of ~105 days this would imply ~127 hours

My estimate was 11.26 hours with a doubling time of 103.6 days

It might be even slightly faster than this at ~99 days

but it's really hard to say, the confidence intervals are crazy

Fair.

"Mongolian", "Tibetan", even "Japanese" cultures Just Don't Scale. Only "Sinic" or "Western" cultures scale.

Mongolian and Tibetan culture and also Japanese are fundamentally opposed and hostile to Sinic culture despite mutual borrowings. It’s not the narcissism of small differences or merely nationalist sentiment these are mutually exclusive character types and visions of life

I am pessimistic on Taalas because I don't see how it scales to large contexts (read [@zephyr\_z9](https://nitter.net/zephyr_z9 "Zephyr") on memory). 60 ms to 1K completion with a 8B model is… neat? A neat parlor trick.
What \*would\* excite me is 17Kt/s for 2M tokens.
<2 minutes for 40 thoughts of 50K tokens each.

I'm super bullish on ACP.

As an engineer, this is your portal to building your own unique context management and control loops on top of agents.

I've essentially turned my editor into an agent-first IDE using this.

Lately, I've gotten super excited about [@zeddotdev](https://nitter.net/zeddotdev "Zed")'s open-source Agent Client Protocol. It's a fantastic way to pass a coding agent the exact context you're looking at in an IDE.

That's why as a pat leave side project I built my own ACP client to replace my Claude Code usage!

It's a few hundred lines of Python hooked up to a [@LangChain](https://nitter.net/LangChain "LangChain") Deep Agent with filesystem and shell access.

It works great out of the box, but the real power comes from customizing the internal agent to use whatever prompts, models, tools, skills etc. you want.

Plus, you get full observability via LangSmith!

I've been using it the past few weeks to great effect. See the links in the replies to try it yourself ⤵️

Zhejiang + Jiangsu + Shanghai are 75% of market cap of robotics parts in China. Biased towards Zhejiang. They are building the machines that'll build the machines that'll build everything else.

I have this feeling that a strange vibe is in the air. Something between: "Okay, guys, it's really starting now, and it's happening faster and is more intense than we expected" – and – "It's already here, it's already taking over our jobs, we have to prepare for everything, it's happening now."

A mixture of tension, worry, unease, anticipation, and – almost delusion. Something huge is definitely happening right now. And the people who control the big companies certainly aren't hiding it.

Do you feel it too?

We struggled to get monitors to catch reward hacking in agents... so we built a new lens. 🔭

Hodoscope allows you to visualize and audit agent trajectories at scale. Using it, we found a brand new vulnerability in commit0 in just minutes! ⚡️

We're excited to see what you uncover! Use Hodoscope to inspect your own agent trajectories and make your systems more robust. 🚀

RLMs are exciting.

GPT-5.2-Codex might be one of the better models for RLMs.

These are tiny experiments, but exciting results so far.

I have a few interesting ideas about how I want to use RLMs for code, long-context tasks, and large-scale analysis.

More soon. Stay tuned!

Introducing DreamDojo, a generalist, interactive robot world model pretrained on 44k hours of human egocentric videos!

Scaling human data pretraining with the largest and most diverse dataset to date for robot world model learning, we achieve spectacular generalization to unseen object interactions and environments. Additionally, after distillation, DreamDojo achieves real-time generation at 10 FPS—you can watch it predict the future as actions stream online, one frame at a time! With these capabilities, we show several key applications: live teloperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning.

See our website: [dreamdojo-world.github.io](http://dreamdojo-world.github.io/)

A typical progressives-more-correct moment btw. Jews as such are okay, the problem is that Hajnalis are bred to empower petty ethnocentrism. Polished the cocks of the pan-European ethny of nobles before, now starved and want to prostrate before another confident high-IQ minority.

Jews are just smarter-than-usual middle easterners, both on the individual and on the cultural level (Judaism + secular developments is better designed than the competition). Capable but normal human tribe.

growing more bullish on [@StepFun\_ai](https://nitter.net/StepFun_ai "StepFun") every day. There are many reasons to feel this, I'll just repeat 3 you might have missed.
1) long ago, [@Jianlin\_S](https://nitter.net/Jianlin_S "jianlin.su") had rated their in-house attention (MFA) as equivalent to MLA
2) they're \*obsessive\* about telemetry

Joy is a competitive super power.

Alysa Liu retired from figure skating at 16.
She was tired of not not having fun, tired of being consumed by her sport.

She came back two years later with a new goal: to have as much fun on the ice as possible. And now she’s an Olympic gold medalist.

Liu won her first national title when she was just 13. But by 16, after competing in the 2022 Olympics, she decided she’d had enough and stepped away. She said pressure and losing her identity trying to be an elite athlete made it all miserable.

But then, she said she went on a ski trip that reminded her just how much fun she could have doing a sport. Something in her brain clicked. Maybe she could bring fun to figure skating. Maybe she could approach it in a way that could be full of joy and life and love.

She unretired at 18 and won a world championship the next year. At 20, she was ready to face these Olympic games differently than in 2022.

Liu went into the women’s figure skating final in third place. After her short program, she said:

“Even if I mess up and fall, that’s totally okay, too. I’m fine with any outcome, as long as I’m out there.”

One of the greatest competitive advantages is having fun. People love to romanticize the athlete, artist, or entrepreneur who has a chip on their shoulder, fueled by anger and resentment.

But the truth is that if you’re not having fun, you are not going to last long at whatever it is you do, and you certainly won’t get the best out of yourself. There’s a foolish idea that you either have to be full of intensity or full of joy. But that’s nonsense.

It’s no surprise one of the first things out of Alysa’s mouth after her free skate was: “That was so much fun!”

Joy and intensity can coexist, and in the best performers, they almost always do.

Alysa is unapologetically authentic and true to her values. She has said where she used to skate to win and be technically perfect, she now uses competition as a chance to show her art, to have fun, and to put herself out there.

She’s a fierce athlete with an infectious sense of joy in her sport.

And she broke USA's 24-year gold medal draught in women’s figure skating doing it.

Excellence requires focus, determination, a little bit of crazy, at times obsession, and living a mundane lifestyle that many people would find boring.

But excellence also requires that you find deep joy in your craft, that you learn how to have fun while working hard.

What makes for excellence—and not just in sports, but in anything—is the combination of intensity and joy. It’s the latter that makes the former sustainable.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.
