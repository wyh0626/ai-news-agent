This morning, the Supreme Court FINALLY issued a ruling on whether Trump could unilaterally impose tariffs.

"The IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."

TL;DR: No more tariffs.

Programmers aren't going away any time soon, the job will just change substantially. Because of the world's unquenchable, ever-growing demand for software, I don't even think the amount of programmers employed will go down, at least not in the near future (4 years).

The process that we'll see is not really comparable to the automation of farming, it's probably more comparable to the introduction of drills, cranes and cement mixers in construction.

Programming will change, but we're still far away from the day when a lawyer/doctor/accountant/architect will be able to maintain & enhance their software stack simply by talking to it.

And even when that day arrives, we'll still have a lot of work remaining for programmers.

"As implementation grows increasingly automated, the core skill of software engineering shifts away from writing code line-by-line and toward shaping systems. Engineers can focus on deciding what should exist, how components fit together, and how complexity remains understandable over time. Good software depends on judgment, communication, and clear abstraction. AI systems amplify these human qualities, rather than replacing them."

The Claude C Compiler is the first AI-generated compiler that builds complex C code, built by [@AnthropicAI](https://nitter.net/AnthropicAI "Anthropic"). Reactions ranged from dismissal as "AI nonsense" to "SW is over": both takes miss the point.

The hardest part of shipping a world model isn’t the model.

It’s the gap between what users type and what the model expects.

It’s not just text → output.

Grant Lee built one of the highest-performing micro-influencer programs with a move that doesn't scale.

He spent hours 1-on-1 with every creator.

No marketing scripts. He personally onboarded them to Gamma and helped refine their hooks and copy.

It felt almost awkward at first because brands usually treat these as transactions.

But by learning the craft himself, he ensured the content felt authentic to their audience - not like an ad.

This decision accelerated Gamma's path to $100M ARR

How unicorn founder [@thisisgrantlee](https://nitter.net/thisisgrantlee "Grant Lee") took Gamma from “the worst idea ever” to a $2.1B company.

VCs hung up on him, friends lied to his face, and signups plateaued. Most founders would have pivoted.

Grant doubled down and went all in on the users first 30 seconds:
• The entire team focused on it for 4 month
• "Time to Value" was their key metric to drive growth

That bet took [@GammaApp](https://nitter.net/GammaApp "Gamma") to 70M users who can't stop sharing it.

In this week’s episode of The Library of Minds, Grant breaks down the playbook for building a breakout AI success: staying ruthless on what matters, mastering creator-driven distribution, and hiring painfully slow.

The obsession with «personal data» (and fear that Chyna will unscrupulously use it) is a legacy of the more degenerate pre-AI «big data» IT culture that optimized ad clicks. We can do that, eg to put a LLaMA 4 checkpoint higher on the LMArena, but it's… kind of futile.

Most medical AI companies rent their intelligence. We train ours. Today [@basetenco](https://nitter.net/basetenco "Baseten") published a case study on how we do it: why we build domain-specific models on peer-reviewed literature instead of using general-purpose AI off the shelf, and what that means for the doctors who use OpenEvidence every day.

"No other product lets you launch ten different training jobs on four different datasets." –Head of Clinical NLP, OpenEvidence

Over 40% of U.S. physicians trust [@EvidenceOpen](https://nitter.net/EvidenceOpen "OpenEvidence")'s platform for fast, accurate medical information. Their secret: custom, specialized models built on Baseten Training.

Here's how we helped them save $1.9M via model training and improved their latency 23x to power 100M+ clinical consultations per year.

From pioneering software-defined networking to backing many of the most ambitious AI labs of this cycle, Martin Casado and Sarah Wang sit at the center of AI’s capital and capability arms race.

We sat down with the a16z duo to unpack how AI investing fundamentally changed: why today’s $100M–$1B rounds are really compute financing vehicles, how venture and growth have blurred into hybrid deals, what it means when model companies can translate dollars directly into capability gains, and whether we are heading towards a boom of specialized apps or a small oligopoly of general models that subsume everything above them.

I've been personally burning through billions of tokens a week for the past few months as a builder. Today I'm excited to announce Hyperagent, by Airtable.

An agents platform where every session gets its own isolated, full computing environment in the cloud — no Mac Mini required. Real browser, code execution, image/video generation, data warehouse access, hundreds of integrations, and the ability to learn any new API as a skill.

Deep domain expertise through skill learning. Teach the agent how your firm evaluates startups or how your team runs due diligence — now anyone on the team gets output that reflects your actual methodology, not a generic template.

One-click deployment into Slack as intelligent coworkers. These aren't bots that wait to be [@mentioned](https://nitter.net/mentioned "Mentioned") — they follow conversations, understand context, and act when relevant.

And a command center to oversee and continuously improve your entire fleet of agents at scale.

We're onboarding early users now. [hyperagent.com](http://hyperagent.com/)

AI models can solve differential equations, write code, and pass the bar exam, but sometimes miss something a five-year-old would catch.

The edges aren't where you expect them.

This is why comparing models matters.

No single benchmark tells you which model will fumble YOUR question. But running the same prompt across multiple models can reveal the gaps in real time.

As promised, I uploaded the code to a fork of the ARC-AGI-3-benchmarking repo:
\- [github.com/voice-from-the-ou…](https://github.com/voice-from-the-outer-world/arc-agi-3-benchmarking)

What I added:
\- my \`state-memory\` agent
\- Local live results viewer with playback and per-step details (action, reasoning, memory, full model input/output)
\- a silly download GIF button on the dashboard in case someone wants to share results of other models
\- a bunch of models incl. Gemini 3.1 Pro and Opus 4.6 via OpenRouter

Everything on how to use it is in the README.

Please don't ask me about any naming like why "state-memory" or why the new agent is in the adcr-agent's directory. It was all designed by the GPT-5.3-Codex gods. I don't dare to question their choices. Just want you to be able to try it out yourself.

This is expensive to run (at least for me). If you run all 3 games with 50 actions Gemini 3.1 Pro will set you back about $15-20. Opus-4.6-Thinking will set you back $35-45.

Smaller models like GLM-5, Kimi-K2.5 Thinking or Gemini-3 Flash are kinda pointless to run, but they will be $5-10 for the 50 steps for each of the 3 games.

I would love to see Opus 4.6 Thinking, GPT-5.2-xhigh and Gemini 3.1 Pro just run all the games until they get stuck or lose.

Not gonna lie; I used to look down on livestreaming as basically "Onlyfans lite". However during my time getting close and helping the Tibetans broadcast their dances, I came to a different realization...

Livestreaming (小红书 & 抖音）essentially allows people who is otherwise unemployable in the general market (a lot of Tibetans did not finish high school, let alone uni) to be able to become genuine entrepreneurs WITHOUT sex work (this includes the not so smart folks from the countryside who can't progress beyond primary maths). They'd even lower the barrier of entry into business by allowing you to setup accounts and trade with just real name verification. To just simply moralize over this is not just wrong, but you will be willingly ignorant since you miss the finer details of what is actually happening.

My suggestion is to join one of these platforms and instead of the typical political shitflinging, get engaged to the people who are in the business. Get to know them and their struggles. It is a humbling experience.

Took the new \`optimize\_anything\` for a spin to optimize a Sudoku solver I wrote a couple of months ago.

14x speedup for $0.27

Very very cool. This is the future.

It consistently matches or outperforms domain-specific tools optimizing code, prompts, agent harnesses, cloud policies, even visuals!

Trust me he isn't, and he has been unnecessarily charitable to Indians if I may say so at times (i.e. sarvam model or whatever it's called). The thing with Teor is that he is maximally determinist. He loves the strong and hates the weak.

Hey everyone this video is fake.

The G1 is 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) tall, 80 pounds. The camera on the robot is a low fidelity realsense camera pointing toward the hands.

It can’t hold a rifle or fire one.

A robot w/ a gun would not use a infantry weapon, it would be custom.

Sometimes OpenAI & Anthropic's coding models are eerily similar in their oversights and misconceptions. But there are many situations where one has an important insight, sees an issue where the other simply doesn't. Lately, I've been finding it very useful to drive my primary coding with Claude code and then have multi-turn discussion on major decisions, or one shot reviews with Codex via a skill.

this one won’t go viral. and pls don't tell the "just ship" prophets.

we're doing the unsexy work of open source: api stability, backwards compat, clear public contract...

that’s how you turn a research prototype into something companies can actually depend on.

TIL galgotias university files more patents than all IITs combined.

not because they’re innovating. bcz they figured out the cheat code.

filing a patent in india costs ₹1,600.

govt reimburses up to ₹2 lakh per filing.

that’s a 125x return. before the patent does anything.

so universities found the playbook:

file 1000 patents → collect ₹20cr → boost NIRF rank → attract more students → collect fees → repeat

the patents? take a guess 🤡

india ranks 5th globally in patent applications.

last among the top 6 in grant rate.
japan converts 70% of filings into grants.

we convert 40%.

we ain’t building but chasing wrong metrics.

and the worst part? the system rewards it.

NIRF counts raw filings, not grants. so the incentive is to file garbage at scale, not build real IP.

this is what happens when you optimize for the scoreboard instead of the game.

we’re really good at looking innovative.
not as good at being it.

fix is simple btw:
reimburse at grant stage, not filing stage. tie incentives to commercialization. weight NIRF on grants, not applications.

but simple fixes don’t happen when the people gaming the system are also the ones writing the policy. need young + smart policy makers

innovation isn’t a form you fill. it’s a product you build. 🫡

Code is starting to look like trained model artifacts.
The most advanced teams are tracing and evaluating agents, then running optimization loops where the agent improves itself with code artifacts versioned and promoted like models using [@wandb](https://nitter.net/wandb "Weights & Biases")

Sufficiently advanced agentic coding is essentially machine learning: the engineer sets up the optimization goal as well as some constraints on the search space (the spec and its tests), then an optimization process (coding agents) iterates until the goal is reached.

The result is a blackbox model (the generated codebase): an artifact that performs the task, that you deploy without ever inspecting its internal logic, just as we ignore individual weights in a neural network.

This implies that all classic issues encountered in ML will soon become problems for agentic coding: overfitting to the spec, Clever Hans shortcuts that don't generalize outside the tests, data leakage, concept drift, etc.

I would also ask: what will be the Keras of agentic coding? What will be the optimal set of high-level abstractions that allow humans to steer codebase 'training' with minimal cognitive overhead?

YES!

This paper basically confirms what many of us already suspected:

If you want better LLM results without paying for longer outputs or fine-tuning, there’s a concrete, low-effort tip:

Duplicate your prompt!

Researchers found that repeating the exact same input can dramatically improve performance (up to a 76% gain on specific tasks).

LLMs process text left to right, each token can only look at the previous context, never ahead.

So when you write a long prompt with context first and the question at the end, the model can rely on that context to answer, but the context was processed before the model even knew the question.

This asymmetry is a basic structural property of how LLMs work.

Repeating the prompt helps counter this limitation by giving the model a second pass over the full context.

There are no new losses to compute and no fancy prompt engineering involved.

It’s just a simple structural hack that works across almost every major model they tested.

Announcing DreamDojo: our open-source, interactive world model that takes robot motor controls and generates the future in pixels. No engine, no meshes, no hand-authored dynamics. It's Simulation 2.0. Time for robotics to take the bitter lesson pill.

Real-world robot learning is bottlenecked by time, wear, safety, and resets. If we want Physical AI to move at pretraining speed, we need a simulator that adapts to pretraining scale with as little human engineering as possible.

Our key insights: (1) human egocentric videos are a scalable source of first-person physics; (2) latent actions make them "robot-readable" across different hardware; (3) real-time inference unlocks live teleop, policy eval, and test-time planning \*inside\* a dream.

We pre-train on 44K hours of human videos: cheap, abundant, and collected with zero robot-in-the-loop. Humans have already explored the combinatorics: we grasp, pour, fold, assemble, fail, retry—across cluttered scenes, shifting viewpoints, changing light, and hour-long task chains—at a scale no robot fleet could match. The missing piece: these videos have no action labels. So we introduce latent actions: a unified representation inferred directly from videos that captures "what changed between world states" without knowing the underlying hardware. This lets us train on any first-person video as if it came with motor commands attached.

As a result, DreamDojo generalizes zero-shot to objects and environments never seen in any robot training set, because humans saw them first.

Next, we post-train onto each robot to fit its specific hardware. Think of it as separating "how the world looks and behaves" from "how this particular robot actuates." The base model follows the general physical rules, then "snaps onto" the robot's unique mechanics. It's kind of like loading a new character and scene assets into Unreal Engine, but done through gradient descent and generalizes far beyond the post-training dataset.

A world simulator is only useful if it runs fast enough to close the loop. We train a real-time version of DreamDojo that runs at 10 FPS, stable for over a minute of continuous rollout. This unlocks exciting possibilities:

\- Live teleoperation \*inside\* a dream. Connect a VR controller, stream actions into DreamDojo, and teleop a virtual robot in real time. We demo this on Unitree G1 with a PICO headset and one RTX 5090.
\- Policy evaluation. You can benchmark a policy checkpoint in DreamDojo instead of the real world. The simulated success rates strongly correlate with real-world results - accurate enough to rank checkpoints without burning a single motor.
\- Model-based planning. Sample multiple action proposals → simulate them all in parallel → pick the best future. Gains +17% real-world success out of the box on a fruit packing task.

We open-source everything!! Weights, code, post-training dataset, eval set, and whitepaper with tons of details to reproduce. DreamDojo is based on NVIDIA Cosmos, which is open-weight too.

2026 is the year of World Models for physical AI. We want you to build with us. Happy scaling!

As promised, I uploaded the code to a fork of the ARC-AGI-3-benchmarking repo:
\- [github.com/voice-from-the-ou…](https://github.com/voice-from-the-outer-world/arc-agi-3-benchmarking)

What I added:
\- my \`state-memory\` agent
\- Local live results viewer with playback and per-step details (action, reasoning, memory, full model input/output)
\- a silly download GIF button on the dashboard in case someone wants to share results of other models
\- a bunch of models incl. Gemini 3.1 Pro and Opus 4.6 via OpenRouter

Everything on how to use it is in the README.

Please don't ask me about any naming like why "state-memory" or why the new agent is in the adcr-agent's directory. It was all designed by the GPT-5.3-Codex gods. I don't dare to question their choices. Just want you to be able to try it out yourself.

This is expensive to run (at least for me). If you run all 3 games with 50 actions Gemini 3.1 Pro will set you back about $15-20. Opus-4.6-Thinking will set you back $35-45.

Smaller models like GLM-5, Kimi-K2.5 Thinking or Gemini-3 Flash are kinda pointless to run, but they will be $5-10 for the 50 steps for each of the 3 games.

I would love to see Opus 4.6 Thinking, GPT-5.2-xhigh and Gemini 3.1 Pro just run all the games until they get stuck or lose.

Announcing DreamDojo: our open-source, interactive world model that takes robot motor controls and generates the future in pixels. No engine, no meshes, no hand-authored dynamics. It's Simulation 2.0. Time for robotics to take the bitter lesson pill.

Real-world robot learning is bottlenecked by time, wear, safety, and resets. If we want Physical AI to move at pretraining speed, we need a simulator that adapts to pretraining scale with as little human engineering as possible.

Our key insights: (1) human egocentric videos are a scalable source of first-person physics; (2) latent actions make them "robot-readable" across different hardware; (3) real-time inference unlocks live teleop, policy eval, and test-time planning \*inside\* a dream.

We pre-train on 44K hours of human videos: cheap, abundant, and collected with zero robot-in-the-loop. Humans have already explored the combinatorics: we grasp, pour, fold, assemble, fail, retry—across cluttered scenes, shifting viewpoints, changing light, and hour-long task chains—at a scale no robot fleet could match. The missing piece: these videos have no action labels. So we introduce latent actions: a unified representation inferred directly from videos that captures "what changed between world states" without knowing the underlying hardware. This lets us train on any first-person video as if it came with motor commands attached.

As a result, DreamDojo generalizes zero-shot to objects and environments never seen in any robot training set, because humans saw them first.

Next, we post-train onto each robot to fit its specific hardware. Think of it as separating "how the world looks and behaves" from "how this particular robot actuates." The base model follows the general physical rules, then "snaps onto" the robot's unique mechanics. It's kind of like loading a new character and scene assets into Unreal Engine, but done through gradient descent and generalizes far beyond the post-training dataset.

A world simulator is only useful if it runs fast enough to close the loop. We train a real-time version of DreamDojo that runs at 10 FPS, stable for over a minute of continuous rollout. This unlocks exciting possibilities:

\- Live teleoperation \*inside\* a dream. Connect a VR controller, stream actions into DreamDojo, and teleop a virtual robot in real time. We demo this on Unitree G1 with a PICO headset and one RTX 5090.
\- Policy evaluation. You can benchmark a policy checkpoint in DreamDojo instead of the real world. The simulated success rates strongly correlate with real-world results - accurate enough to rank checkpoints without burning a single motor.
\- Model-based planning. Sample multiple action proposals → simulate them all in parallel → pick the best future. Gains +17% real-world success out of the box on a fruit packing task.

We open-source everything!! Weights, code, post-training dataset, eval set, and whitepaper with tons of details to reproduce. DreamDojo is based on NVIDIA Cosmos, which is open-weight too.

2026 is the year of World Models for physical AI. We want you to build with us. Happy scaling!

Uniquely American story

Americans excel at doing fun things

The best of our country do it for the love of the game

Joy is a competitive super power.

Alysa Liu retired from figure skating at 16.
She was tired of not not having fun, tired of being consumed by her sport.

She came back two years later with a new goal: to have as much fun on the ice as possible. And now she’s an Olympic gold medalist.

Liu won her first national title when she was just 13. But by 16, after competing in the 2022 Olympics, she decided she’d had enough and stepped away. She said pressure and losing her identity trying to be an elite athlete made it all miserable.

But then, she said she went on a ski trip that reminded her just how much fun she could have doing a sport. Something in her brain clicked. Maybe she could bring fun to figure skating. Maybe she could approach it in a way that could be full of joy and life and love.

She unretired at 18 and won a world championship the next year. At 20, she was ready to face these Olympic games differently than in 2022.

Liu went into the women’s figure skating final in third place. After her short program, she said:

“Even if I mess up and fall, that’s totally okay, too. I’m fine with any outcome, as long as I’m out there.”

One of the greatest competitive advantages is having fun. People love to romanticize the athlete, artist, or entrepreneur who has a chip on their shoulder, fueled by anger and resentment.

But the truth is that if you’re not having fun, you are not going to last long at whatever it is you do, and you certainly won’t get the best out of yourself. There’s a foolish idea that you either have to be full of intensity or full of joy. But that’s nonsense.

It’s no surprise one of the first things out of Alysa’s mouth after her free skate was: “That was so much fun!”

Joy and intensity can coexist, and in the best performers, they almost always do.

Alysa is unapologetically authentic and true to her values. She has said where she used to skate to win and be technically perfect, she now uses competition as a chance to show her art, to have fun, and to put herself out there.

She’s a fierce athlete with an infectious sense of joy in her sport.

And she broke USA's 24-year gold medal draught in women’s figure skating doing it.

Excellence requires focus, determination, a little bit of crazy, at times obsession, and living a mundane lifestyle that many people would find boring.

But excellence also requires that you find deep joy in your craft, that you learn how to have fun while working hard.

What makes for excellence—and not just in sports, but in anything—is the combination of intensity and joy. It’s the latter that makes the former sustainable.
