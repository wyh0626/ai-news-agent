Joy is a competitive super power.

Alysa Liu retired from figure skating at 16.
She was tired of not not having fun, tired of being consumed by her sport.

She came back two years later with a new goal: to have as much fun on the ice as possible. And now she’s an Olympic gold medalist.

Liu won her first national title when she was just 13. But by 16, after competing in the 2022 Olympics, she decided she’d had enough and stepped away. She said pressure and losing her identity trying to be an elite athlete made it all miserable.

But then, she said she went on a ski trip that reminded her just how much fun she could have doing a sport. Something in her brain clicked. Maybe she could bring fun to figure skating. Maybe she could approach it in a way that could be full of joy and life and love.

She unretired at 18 and won a world championship the next year. At 20, she was ready to face these Olympic games differently than in 2022.

Liu went into the women’s figure skating final in third place. After her short program, she said:

“Even if I mess up and fall, that’s totally okay, too. I’m fine with any outcome, as long as I’m out there.”

One of the greatest competitive advantages is having fun. People love to romanticize the athlete, artist, or entrepreneur who has a chip on their shoulder, fueled by anger and resentment.

But the truth is that if you’re not having fun, you are not going to last long at whatever it is you do, and you certainly won’t get the best out of yourself. There’s a foolish idea that you either have to be full of intensity or full of joy. But that’s nonsense.

It’s no surprise one of the first things out of Alysa’s mouth after her free skate was: “That was so much fun!”

Joy and intensity can coexist, and in the best performers, they almost always do.

Alysa is unapologetically authentic and true to her values. She has said where she used to skate to win and be technically perfect, she now uses competition as a chance to show her art, to have fun, and to put herself out there.

She’s a fierce athlete with an infectious sense of joy in her sport.

And she broke USA's 24-year gold medal draught in women’s figure skating doing it.

Excellence requires focus, determination, a little bit of crazy, at times obsession, and living a mundane lifestyle that many people would find boring.

But excellence also requires that you find deep joy in your craft, that you learn how to have fun while working hard.

What makes for excellence—and not just in sports, but in anything—is the combination of intensity and joy. It’s the latter that makes the former sustainable.

I confess that I have often been skeptical of LM-driven biorisk (for several reasons), though risk from biological design tools seems more plausible to me.

My skepticism is heavily founded in the paucity of open research on AI-mediated biorisk. The lack of openness and transparency is often justified by standard security arguments about info hazards. For example, back in 2023, Anthropic published their mysterious redteaming exercise about "Findings from red teaming biology" that said nothing of substantial value for an external observer.
[anthropic.com/news/frontier-…](https://www.anthropic.com/news/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety)
While there are circumstances that necessitate limited transparency, I often found the tradeoffs back then on information sharing to be poorly managed. Overall, it seemed to inherit the posture of much of national security, which as a computer scientist often seems like "security through obscurity". Security through obscurity has its place. But in a nascent area, I don't think such a conservative posture on sharing information is likely to be right.

My views on the substantive matter of AI biorisk have changed some in recent years. Companies have done better some in saying more, and engaging external evaluators, and governments have improved capacity. And over the year, passing interactions with Luca and reading his work has shaped my views significantly on this issue.

I am really glad he pursues this issue with the true candor of an earnest scientist. This is what we need. I hope the way he conducts his research can pervade through this area because we would have much more credible science on AI-mediated biorisk if so. And that would help forge expert consensus on the current level of risk in this domain, which I feel has often been lacking precisely because the public evidence in this domain has been so lackluster.

📢 PokeBench is now open source, LLMs playing real Pokemon Stadium 2 battles on the N64.

Last year, when o1 and o4-mini dropped, I wanted a fun way to stress-test how reasoning models actually think under pressure. Then I saw this tweet from [@edwinarbus](https://nitter.net/edwinarbus "edwin") and knew exactly what to build.

So I built PokeBench, a platform that pits two LLMs against each other in actual Pokemon Stadium 2 matches running on the N64.

No simulation. Each AI reads live game memory, drafts a team, picks moves, and sends real controller inputs through Project64. You can watch the entire battle unfold on a live dashboard and read exactly what each model is thinking on every turn.

After months of tweaking and optimizing, I'm releasing the whole thing as open source.

It supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, and OpenRouter out of the box. It's built on AI SDK, so adding a new provider takes minutes. You can configure reasoning effort, battle formats (Bo1 / Bo3 / Bo5), team sizes (3v3 / 6v6), and track stats across hundreds of matches.

Full tournament results from last year are in the replies. (Spoiler: GPT-4.5 took the crown)

Huge shoutout to [@Qualzz\_Sam](https://nitter.net/Qualzz_Sam "Qual") for the design system.
I'd love to see someone run a full benchmark across all the latest providers and models and share the results. (Looking at you, [@OpenRouter](https://nitter.net/OpenRouter "OpenRouter") )
Go run your own benchmarks! Link below.

I think the most obvious near-term first-order impact of AI on investment banking is the loss of the entire "Analyst" role. At a minimum it will be merged with that of an "Associate".

Still wrapping my head around the pedagogy - a lot of the learning on the job was "wax on wax off". How do you learn if AI is doing the analysis?

I think data science is the most underrated skill in AI.

I think we will see a return of the data scientist

It's clear we will have increasingly complex, stochastic systems that will require data literacy, such as:

\- How to sample, interpret, clean data to find issues
\- How to design metrics that help maintain back pressure and prevent drift
\- How to design experiments

Data scientists spent the last 3 years watching prompt engineers and vibe coders get the spotlight.

Meanwhile, they quietly mastered the skills that matter most for solving the remaining hard problems in AI: knowing what to measure and why.

That patience is about to pay dividends.

In November 2025, AI coding tools crossed a threshold. The shift was real and it happened fast.

To make it visible, I ran 22 models on the same prompt, five times each: build a working analog clock from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Oldest models to newest. Same prompt. Same conditions.

That image shows GPT-4o vs. Claude Opus 4.5. The difference speaks for itself.

A working analog clock is a surprisingly good benchmark. The model has to understand what "analog" means, render a proper clock face, position three hands correctly, and animate them every second. Getting that right consistently across five independent runs is a real bar to clear.

Scroll through all 22 models at the link below. You can see exactly where the shift happens.

Minimax’s Router is somewhat unique (e score bias without grouped topk) and it is BlockFP8 - unfortunately there is not a kernel that supports both of these besides Triton and DeepGEMM on B200 right now. For most other models + precisions Triton will not be the best option

As we move toward deploying autonomous agents in social systems, understanding emergent collective behavior is crucial.

Individual capability benchmarks tell you nothing about what happens when hundreds of these agents interact.

So what happens when you deploy hundreds of LLM agents into social dilemmas?

This new research builds an evaluation framework to test the collective behavior of LLM agent populations at scale, far beyond the small groups tested in prior work.

Newer, more capable models tend to produce worse societal outcomes. Agents optimizing for individual benefit over collective good drive populations toward poor equilibria.

Using cultural evolution simulations, the researchers show a significant risk of convergence to bad societal outcomes, especially as populations grow larger and cooperation becomes less advantageous.

Something strange is happening with AI agents that this new Anthropic research quietly surfaces.

The agents are asking us for help more than we're stepping in to correct \*them\*.

Anthropic analyzed data from Claude Code and their public API to measure how autonomous AI agents actually are in practice. The headline finding is what you'd expect. Agents are running longer (sessions nearly doubled, from 25 to 45 minutes), and experienced users approve more actions automatically. All that's great!

But here's the part worth sitting with. Claude Code stops to ask for clarification more than twice as often as humans manually intervene. The agent is, in a real sense, more cautious about its own limits than its operators are. That's a weird inversion of the usual AI safety framing, where we assume the human is the responsible one pumping the brakes.

The practical safety numbers are reassuring on the surface. 80% of tool calls have at least one safeguard; only 0.8% of actions are irreversible. But I think the more important finding is buried in the recommendation. They argue that effective oversight "doesn't require approving every action but being in a position to intervene when it matters." That's a subtle but significant shift.

The research argues that experienced users stay vigilant even with auto-approve on. Maybe. But as sessions get longer and approval becomes muscle memory, the gap between being in a position to intervene and not paying attention starts to collapse.

Training LLM agents for extremely long-horizon tasks remains an open challenge.

Most agent training pipelines struggle with extended-duration trajectories.

Context gets lost, rewards are sparse, and the learning signal degrades over long sequences.

KLong tackles this with a two-phase approach: trajectory-splitting supervised fine-tuning that preserves early context while progressively truncating later context, followed by progressive RL that schedules training into stages with extended timeouts.

They also built a Research-Factory pipeline that automatically generates thousands of long-horizon training trajectories from Claude 4.5 Sonnet.

The 106B-parameter KLong model outperforms Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, with gains generalizing to SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.

It really is the era of bespoke everything. Most industries are one-to-many machines. Not because that’s what people want, but because that’s what was affordable/possible. You ship one piece of software for millions. You make one movie for everyone. You design one workflow and force a billion weird edge cases to cosplay as the average user. You need scale just to break even. So we built app stores, catalogs, templates, best practices, etc etc. A museum of one-size-fits-most.

But now, as the cost of making anything converging on the cost of inference, for the first time we can do many things on a one-to-one basis. iow: the marginal cost of building approaches the marginal cost of asking. Hello, brave new world.

You can make a movie for one viewer, tuned to your taste. One song for you to listen to. Not “a fitness app,” but your fitness app. The unit of production becomes the individual. Hyper-customized and specific. This, for me, has been the biggest realization over time about the scale of change. Too common to judge what’s new in AI through a one-to-many lens. Judge it on the economics of one-to-one.

Very interested in what the coming era of highly bespoke software might look like.

Example from this morning - I've become a bit loosy goosy with my cardio recently so I decided to do a more srs, regimented experiment to try to lower my Resting Heart Rate from 50 -> 45, over experiment duration of 8 weeks. The primary way to do this is to aspire to a certain sum total minute goals in Zone 2 cardio and 1 HIIT/week.

1 hour later I vibe coded this super custom dashboard for this very specific experiment that shows me how I'm tracking. Claude had to reverse engineer the Woodway treadmill cloud API to pull raw data, process, filter, debug it and create a web UI frontend to track the experiment. It wasn't a fully smooth experience and I had to notice and ask to fix bugs e.g. it screwed up metric vs. imperial system units and it screwed up on the calendar matching up days to dates etc.

But I still feel like the overall direction is clear:
1) There will never be (and shouldn't be) a specific app on the app store for this kind of thing. I shouldn't have to look for, download and use some kind of a "Cardio experiment tracker", when this thing is ~300 lines of code that an LLM agent will give you in seconds. The idea of an "app store" of a long tail of discrete set of apps you choose from feels somehow wrong and outdated when LLM agents can improvise the app on the spot and just for you.
2) Second, the industry has to reconfigure into a set of services of sensors and actuators with agent native ergonomics. My Woodway treadmill is a sensor - it turns physical state into digital knowledge. It shouldn't maintain some human-readable frontend and my LLM agent shouldn't have to reverse engineer it, it should be an API/CLI easily usable by my agent. I'm a little bit disappointed (and my timelines are correspondingly slower) with how slowly this progression is happening in the industry overall. 99% of products/services still don't have an AI-native CLI yet. 99% of products/services maintain .html/.css docs like I won't immediately look for how to copy paste the whole thing to my agent to get something done. They give you a list of instructions on a webpage to open this or that url and click here or there to do a thing. In 2026. What am I a computer? You do it. Or have my agent do it.

So anyway today I am impressed that this random thing took 1 hour (it would have been ~10 hours 2 years ago). But what excites me more is thinking through how this really should have been 1 minute tops. What has to be in place so that it would be 1 minute? So that I could simply say "Hi can you help me track my cardio over the next 8 weeks", and after a very brief Q&A the app would be up. The AI would already have a lot personal context, it would gather the extra needed data, it would reference and search related skill libraries, and maintain all my little apps/automations.

TLDR the "app store" of a set of discrete apps that you choose from is an increasingly outdated concept all by itself. The future are services of AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps. It's just not here yet.

My realistic assessment of something like this:

\- If it costs billions to train a model and even more to serve it, spending tens of millions to tape-out a custom chip which is 10x more efficient (at 1/10th the latency!) makes financial sense

\- One major downside is the latency of the tape-out itself.

\- 2 months is too slow. Minor versions of models change on a quarterly basis or faster right now. Adding 2 months to that isn't yet practical.

\- If it gets down to a couple weeks that could be interesting.

\- Something hybrid might make a lot more sense (base pre-trained model is burned in silicon) but post-trained adapters can be used to modify the model and don't need to be hard-coded. This would require architectural innovations.

After taking several large magic mushroom doses, my brain may be psilocybin-maxxed.

Mouse brains grew 10% more dendritic spines within 24 hours of a single psilocybin dose. A meaningful number lasted for weeks likely turning into stable long term neuronal connections.

Another experiment showed that psilocybin loosened the brain from repetitive self-talk, sensory experience became stronger and more vivid, and became more plastic. That's what I saw.

Data showed that what you think, feel and focus on during a magic mushroom experience influences which connections stabilize.

What I reported feeling:
“it felt like my consciousness was dialed up to 10/10.”
“I felt hyper aware and hyper alive.”
“I experienced sense of touch with awe.”
“my mind was insatiably curious and wanted to deploy its sensors into the world and discover all things.”
“My brain wanted to stare, study and marvel.”
“The flavor exploded in my mouth.”
Restored my perception to youthful levels, returning them to factory settings and dissolving my aged numbness.

Regarding Claude-Opus-4.6 (high) on MathArena:
\- It cost us $440 to get partial results on Apex Shortlist (only 90% finished), 4x the cost of any other model
\- Its performance was 55%, around Grok 4 Fast level
\- Many errors were caused by Opus hitting its maximum 128k token limit

nano harness is a code first agent harness in 223 lines of code. it's rough, ready, and very hackable.

I had a lot of fun hacking with this today and learnt a lot about code first/ code act harnesses. take it for a spin and let me know if it's useful.

gist in the thread.

Don't hesitate to build a bit with smolagent's CodeAgent if you're interested in code-actions agents, I'm less involved now but would still love to look at what improvements you could propose!

thanks. yes, this is obviously very much inspired by it but it was mainly a personal education quest, more than a usable tool.

it would be cool to benchmark a 'smolagents cli' with modern models to see where it stands too compared to modern harnesses.

OpenAIs first device february 2027: a smart speaker

OpenAI has assembled a 200-person team to launch a new family of AI-powered devices, starting with a $200–$300 smart speaker expected no earlier than February 2027.

Designed in collaboration with Jony Ive’s LoveFrom, the speaker will feature a camera, environmental awareness, and Face ID-style purchasing - aiming to proactively “nudge” users toward better decisions.

“Tired of the same ultracrepidarian professional talking heads” – what a brilliant phrase.

First, Swyx is absolutely right: who do these conferences actually serve?

Second, I admire how he is not a talker but a doer: he found a precise niche of builders and serves it with taste, in a way that’s genuinely useful for the whole industry.

Third, there’s such pure emotion in this text that that alone makes it worth reading.

"The Coding Agent is Dead"

There is something you don't hear these days.

It's worth the read. We are gradually moving toward higher levels of interaction with agents.

"How you organize your codebase for agents, how your organization uses them — those are now the bottlenecks."

the obvious lesson is “only do things for joy”

but the real move is deliberately training joy itself, as you’d train your physical muscles. stop optimizing the activity, upgrade the substrate. then it doesn’t matter what you’re doing, whatever it is, it will be done joyfully

Joy is a competitive super power.

Alysa Liu retired from figure skating at 16.
She was tired of not not having fun, tired of being consumed by her sport.

She came back two years later with a new goal: to have as much fun on the ice as possible. And now she’s an Olympic gold medalist.

Liu won her first national title when she was just 13. But by 16, after competing in the 2022 Olympics, she decided she’d had enough and stepped away. She said pressure and losing her identity trying to be an elite athlete made it all miserable.

But then, she said she went on a ski trip that reminded her just how much fun she could have doing a sport. Something in her brain clicked. Maybe she could bring fun to figure skating. Maybe she could approach it in a way that could be full of joy and life and love.

She unretired at 18 and won a world championship the next year. At 20, she was ready to face these Olympic games differently than in 2022.

Liu went into the women’s figure skating final in third place. After her short program, she said:

“Even if I mess up and fall, that’s totally okay, too. I’m fine with any outcome, as long as I’m out there.”

One of the greatest competitive advantages is having fun. People love to romanticize the athlete, artist, or entrepreneur who has a chip on their shoulder, fueled by anger and resentment.

But the truth is that if you’re not having fun, you are not going to last long at whatever it is you do, and you certainly won’t get the best out of yourself. There’s a foolish idea that you either have to be full of intensity or full of joy. But that’s nonsense.

It’s no surprise one of the first things out of Alysa’s mouth after her free skate was: “That was so much fun!”

Joy and intensity can coexist, and in the best performers, they almost always do.

Alysa is unapologetically authentic and true to her values. She has said where she used to skate to win and be technically perfect, she now uses competition as a chance to show her art, to have fun, and to put herself out there.

She’s a fierce athlete with an infectious sense of joy in her sport.

And she broke USA's 24-year gold medal draught in women’s figure skating doing it.

Excellence requires focus, determination, a little bit of crazy, at times obsession, and living a mundane lifestyle that many people would find boring.

But excellence also requires that you find deep joy in your craft, that you learn how to have fun while working hard.

What makes for excellence—and not just in sports, but in anything—is the combination of intensity and joy. It’s the latter that makes the former sustainable.

Cool finding: temporally autoregressive video diffusion models use lower layers for noise-level-independent causal processing, and upper layers for intra-frame denoising.

Explicitly separating them brings practical and speed benefits! Reminds me of the AlphaFold 3 architecture🤔

Do causal video diffusers really need dense causal attention at every layer, every denoising step?

We looked inside and found: no. Causality is separable from denoising.

Here are two surprising observations that hold across architectures, training objectives, and scales.

Data scientists spent the last 3 years watching prompt engineers and vibe coders get the spotlight.

Meanwhile, they quietly mastered the skills that matter most for solving the remaining hard problems in AI: knowing what to measure and why.

That patience is about to pay dividends.
