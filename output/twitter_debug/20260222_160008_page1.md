Pretraining with dynamics models of motor behavior (aka world models) from video will be much more central to robotics than VLMs. There are multiple choices of representations (e.g. 3D? JEPA?) but we will figure this out by and by. Exciting times!

But we won’t need that soon

My timeline is pretty short on reaching 99.999...% of software written by AI, but still pretty long on reaching 100%.

And by "writing" I don't mean just the act of typing ascii characters into source code. I mean targeted human interventions that require non-trivial understanding of the system.

I guess the question is will AI writing software be more like self-driving cars or more like "AGI".

Self-driving cars could drive on 99.99% of roads in 99.99% of conditions for like a decade now. We still don't have 100% self-driving cars, even Waymo needs ocasional human intervention.

One important difference is that writing 99% software feels more autonomous than a car which drives itself 99% of the time (which would require a human to attend to it pretty much all the time).

People keep using the word "irrational" when describing the general public's opposition to AI. That word has meaning. Let's start with the colloquial: making consistent decisions against one's best interests given information that one has.

What is the current information people have? On the one hand, they have the chatbots. For most people, they are fun and sometimes helpful on the margin. Adoption in consequential contexts has been spotty and surveys show very mixed attitudes in those settings (see 2025 BCG survey).

On the other hand, you have the heads of almost every AI company saying that AI will 1) lead to \*huge\* job losses and 2) potentially much much worse. There is some vague hand waving about curing cancer or going to space, but the main message is "it is coming for your job and your life".

Putting the two together, you get exactly what you see in the data: "I like these chatbots, but I do not like AI and I do not want it to get better or expand." This is not a contradiction. The former refers to the current chatbots that people ask random questions, the latter represents the thing that everyone in power tells them will take their jobs.

The response in DC and the coasts has been: you don't know what's good for you, move out of the way, you're stupid and irrational. How has that response worked out the last 15 years?

If those who see the positives, the huge potential benefits of AI to grow the pie and make life better for all (which includes myself), do not take this political economy into account, I'm afraid that the populist wave of the last decade will look like child's play. A dress rehearsal.

Scott makes a lot of bold predictions in this post about the future of software that align with what I’ve been tweeting about recently too:

\- Software companies will get fully automated including everything handled today by PMs, developers, designers, sales reps, and marketers
\- Quant-like entities will emerge that automatically identify needs in the market and build and iterate on products to solve them in comically fast times
\- These entities can create thousands of high-quality products this way that compete in every niche
\- New products will get copied almost immediately, including ones created by competing entities
\- Bootstrappers, who thrive in niches today, will struggle to compete
\- Traditional venture-backed software companies will struggle too because everything takes too long, from fundraising to actual product development with human teams.
\- To prepare for this world, you should try to automate absolutely everything you can today

what is the minimum population X of immortal humans needed to recreate modern industrial civilization from scratch?

they start with basic clothing, primitive tools, a year of food, and full internalized knowledge of all human technology

the challenge is purely logistical: gathering resources, processing materials, and building the machines

given that X, how long would it take?

every other ai researcher i talk to want to start a coffee shop / cafe after everything is over.

i was actually seriously looking into this. and then i realise we should be able to get AI (e.g., Gemini) to do this automatically for us. Lease a place, negotiate a good price, do branding, marketing, hire baristas.

they should be even be able to do "human-use" (and call humans as tools when they have to).

and then they should be able to be able to scale this up. run multiple businesses, cafes, pet shops, tuition centers, grocery marts etc...

What people underestimate about functional software is the compound effect of thousands of customer feedback loops.

Every edge case handled, every workflow refined, every integration battle-tested that's years of compounding knowledge baked into the product. AI doesn't shortcut that. You still need the reps.

And once you've crossed a certain scale threshold, you really don't want to rebuild that. A 5-person team can vibe-code their own CRM. A 300-person company? You need something that's survived 10,000 weird edge cases across hundreds of orgs.

No one's recoding their own Stripe. No one's recoding their own CRM at scale not because they can't build the UI, but because the system of record underneath is where the real value lives.

Interfaces might evolve or even disappear in some cases. But the underlying systems and the compounded product intelligence? That's the moat.

"Creation as a Service" will always beat "Software as a Service". I don't want your lowest-common-denominator software. I want software to work for me and meet my needs. I want platforms and infrastructure.

To me, Slack is a good example of an ideal in-between of SaaS and Platform. I have zero interest in vibe coding my own Slack. (It's also particularly difficult software to perfect and scale, and if you disagree you have no idea how to build software 🤡).

I do have a strong interest in extending Slack with our own agents. As I shared yesterday, more of our company runs on Slack-based "@" agents. We're making it easier than ever to deploy Slack agents on Vercel, with our AI infrastructure (gateway, workflows, sandbox, etc), starting with [@v0](https://nitter.net/v0 "v0").

A lot of SaaS might be cooked, but Salesforce has a generational re-birth opportunity with Slack.

Actually I've looked past the specific claims about LCOE and MWh, only at the relative ranking, and now that I've been reminded to look again, it makes zero sense. $300/MWh is bullshit. That's $0.3/kWh. Real finnish electricity is like $0.05.

today [@taalas\_inc](https://nitter.net/taalas_inc "Taalas Inc.") launched their HC1 asic that can inference 17k tok/s. Sure, it's a shitty 3.1 8B today which is a 1.5 year gap.

But read the details to the HC2 this winter, and do the math — this timeline will converge to 0 in the next 2 years.

Build accordingly.

Seedance 2.0’s public API timeline has been delayed. The API was aiming for Feb 24, but it’s getting pushed (no new date yet).

Been chatting with the ByteDance team on the integration side and confirmed it.

They’re likely putting stronger copyright/deepfake guardrails in place first — tighter filtering, blocking unlicensed real-person likeness videos, plus compliance monitoring — before opening it up more broadly.

We finally have the concise definition of the Western Civilization and the «free world» as such.
Ironic. Jews like Strauss and Shestov, grounded in European culture, blathered about the role of some «Athens». But Americans of this century have opted for a simpler, purer formula.

Christian faith used to hold that the Church is “spiritual Israel” and Jesus says the covenant is with Christians. In the face of Israel existing for real and being Jewish, this position has declined.
But Cruz-style “Judeo-Christianity” is a wholly different neo-religion.

"Sinclair said advances in biotechnology are rapidly improving scientists’ ability to control human biology.

He predicted that within the next 10 to 20 years, modern healthcare systems could appear outdated as treatments shift toward preventing and reversing ageing itself.

“For many years, we ignored ageing,” Sinclair said, adding that ageing should no longer be accepted as inevitable.

“Ageing is a medical condition that is increasingly treatable.”"

🦔 H100 GPUs that cost $40,000 new are now selling for around $6,000 on eBay, an 85% drop. The math on why is straightforward: it costs about 11x as much to run an H100 for inference as a B300. Anyone running H100s needs to charge dramatically more than competitors on newer hardware.

Upgrading isn't simple either. At a $50,000 price tag for a B200, it takes about 33 months to break even on the upgrade from an H100. And the B300s are already making B200s less attractive.

My Take
I've been covering the depreciation problem in AI infrastructure for a while now. Companies are booking these GPUs on five to six year depreciation schedules when Nvidia releases new generations every two years. Michael Burry flagged Big Tech lengthening depreciation timelines as suspicious because it hides the real losses. A hedge fund manager I wrote about found that industry insiders estimate actual component lifespans at 3-10 years, but the economics don't work at any of those numbers.

The hyperscalers are sitting on hundreds of thousands of GPUs that lose value every time Nvidia announces something new. David McWilliams called them "digital lettuce" because they go stale while you're still installing them. The difference between what the books say these assets are worth and what you could actually sell them for is enormous. At some point that gap has to be reconciled. H100s selling for 85% off on eBay is a preview of the writedowns coming to earnings reports.

Bytedance just dropped a paper that might change how AI thinks.

Literally.

They figured out why LLMs fail at long reasoning — and framed it as chemistry.

The discovery:

Chain-of-thought isn't just words. It's molecular structure.

Three bond types:

• Deep reasoning = covalent bonds (strong, unbreakable)
• Self-reflection = hydrogen bonds (flexible, context-aware)
• Exploration = van der Waals (weak, ever-present)
Why most AI "thinking" sucks:

Everyone's been imitating keywords — "wait," "let me check" — without building the actual bonds.

It's like copying the shape of a protein without the atomic forces holding it together.

Bytedance proved: structure emerges from training, not prompting.

The fix: Mole-Syn

Their method doesn't just generate text. It synthesizes stable thought molecules.

Results: better reasoning, more stable RL training.

Bytedance is treating AI reasoning like organic chemistry — and it works.

It's funny, because it's true! DeepSeek V3 did come out roughly 10000 hours ago, and it did use MTP solely for densifying training and improving representations, not for inference acceleration. To this day, nobody (?) uses V3 + MTP.
Thankfully other models exist now, eg Step 3.5

China has succeeded in running a tram-like vehicle without laying rails.

This system virtually recreates the track using only lines painted on the road and LiDAR sensors, and has been in operation as an actual urban transport system since 2018. This is the next generation of transportation that significantly reduces infrastructure costs.

Cloning any random piece of SaaS is something that could already be done before agentic coding, and the economics of it haven't changed meaningfully. Before, writing the clone would cost 0.5-1% of the valuation of the legacy SaaS company. Now it might be 0.1%. It doesn't make a difference -- if you can pull it off profitably today you could also have done it profitably in the past.

The code is a very small part of the process of making such a clone successful, and the reason legacy software has often bad UX is not because code was expensive to write.

サカナAIの伊藤COO「各国No.1企業に投資意欲」

日経新聞にて、Sakana AI 伊藤錬のインタビューが公開されました。インド「AIインパクトサミット」から見えた世界のAI投資の潮流変化と、米国以外のAI企業が生きる道である「垂直（分野特化）」戦略について語りました。 [nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC2…](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC208WI0Q6A220C2000000/)

【記事 のハイライト】

1\. 各国No.1企業への投資意欲
「各国は自分でゼロからAIモデルを構築するより、いろんなAIを活用する技術が大事だという方向にシフトしている。投資家は各国のチャンピオンAI企業への投資意欲を強めており、インドやフランス、日本など米国以外のAI企業にも勝ち目があると考えるようになった」

2\. トップ企業との技術差
「技術のオープン化も早く、巨額の資金を投じる米国のトップ5と追随する企業の技術の差は3〜6カ月程度にすぎない。いよいよ米国のハイパースケーラー以外にも投資する時期が来たという雰囲気がある。新しい時代のアセットに1%でも投資しないのは逆にリスクだと気付いたのだろう」

3\. 生きる道は「垂直（分野特化）」
「ハイパースケーラーの汎用AIモデルは水平型だ。医療や金融など何にでも使えるとうたうが、各業界の中核業務では結局使えない。何でもやるのではなく『垂直（分野特化）』に取り組めば米国以外の国にも生きる道がある。サカナAIは金融と防衛のユースケースに特化している」

4\. 「怖くないAI」という第3の道
「米国のように独占もしないし、中国のような言論の偏りもない、『怖くないAI』を打ち出すべきだ。ウェルフェア（幸福）といった人間が持つ価値観の部分にAIをどう使うかを声高に語るインドの文脈は、日本にとっても使い道がある」

We gathered everything you need to know about it in one place:

• Full architectural breakdown:
\- Gateway control plane
\- Scheduled reasoning
\- File-backed identity
\- Hybrid memory, etc.

• Lightweight alternatives you can actually run
• Practical use cases
• What the "local agent boom" really means

Clarification regarding a misquote on Deepseek - at [@SarvamAI](https://nitter.net/SarvamAI "Sarvam AI") we admire the Deepseek team and follow and learn from their research.

The only point worth noting - the Sarvam 105B model achieves on reasoning benchmarks similar or better scores than the Deepseek R1 did when it was released. And we got there with a small team and with a smaller model size. This only points to the rapidly improving productivity gains in research as AI gets adopted by LLM teams across the world.

More details coming soon in our technical blog. Until then, try out the model on Indus and give us your feedback: [indus.sarvam.ai](https://indus.sarvam.ai/)

I guess it's natural to assume that competence in India is very unevenly distributed, so they can have a professional AI company and also Soviet tier propagandists in Indiatimes. Straight up fabricating a direct quote from your own entrepreneur is a bit too much, though.

people don't get the «not x—y», huh
it is a subtle issue, admittedly. It's not about the sentence structure; it's about salient dichotomies. LLMs spam it because of post-training on fancy writing patterns from people like PG; often using borderline synonyms.

Writing doesn't generate ideas—thinking does; writing is just a facilitating crutch. But LLMs are literally generative, and so they generate literary slop as they «write». (This kind of alliteration/rhyme is also beyond LLMs). Emdash trick serves to pinpoint the thought.
