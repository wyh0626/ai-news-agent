I don’t get all the hate that the phrase “stochastic parrots” gets.

The main thing you should learn from all this is just how powerful very very very large parrots would be.

\## the egocentric fallacy: "the most important part of a trend will happen to be right now when i randomly decide to care a lot about it because of some dude's post"

just to punch strawmen with Han (whom i love), this meta-principle of "choose the laggards in hopes they catch up" is a noob mistake and has a lower chance of working than most people are trained to appreciate (because they fundamentally want to believe in equality when capitalism fundamentally does not).

generation after generation of investors from Thiel to [@Chamath](https://nitter.net/Chamath "Chamath Palihapitiya") have learned painful lessons to double down on winners rather than do relative value trades.

a simple thought exercise is to ask if the Software Engineering number goes up to 80% or 90% in the next 5 years would you be better of working on Back Office Automation? (no, the answer is no, some folks are so capitalism illiterate you need that to be spelled out) . So then if we just zoomed from 10 to 50% in the last 2 years, it is actually a classic egotistical fallacy that this exact moment is when AI x SWE peaked and it's all relative downside from here vs other domains, which is what is implied by the chart below: who are you, who are we, what evidence do you have, to say we are anywhere even close to done on the largest product market fit we've seen in software business history?

[@nlw](https://nitter.net/nlw "Nathaniel Whittemore") has been echoing my thoughts here - kode is the lions share of agi and basically by betting on anything else you may well be rich and you may well be happier and you may well have much more positive social impact on the world.... but do not confuse that for having higher expected value.

This should be a given. Although there are definitely cases you could want to do some ops on CPU if you have crap load of multiprocessing. The real trick is to transfer between GPU and CPU in low precision

Here's a neural net optimization trick that leads to ~4x faster CPU to GPU transfers.

Imagine an image classification task.

\- We define the network, load the data and transform it.
\- In the training loop, we transfer the data to the GPU and train.

Here's the problem with this:

If you look at the profiler:
\- Most of the time/resources will be allocated to the kernel (the actual training code).
\- However, a significant amount of time will also be dedicated to data transfer from CPU to GPU (this appears under cudaMemcpyAsync).

Reducing the data transfer is simple.

Recall that the original dataset was composed of pixel values. These were 8-bit integers, and we transformed them to 32-bit floats.

Next, we transferred these 32-bit floating-point tensors to the GPU. This meant that transforming the data led to more data (4x) being transferred.

The solution is simple.

Moving the transformation step after the data transfer, since in that case, we shall transfer 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats.

As a result, you will notice a significant drop in the data transfer step.

Of course, this technique doesn’t apply to all neural network use cases, like NLP, where we inherently deal with 32-bit float embeddings.

However, whenever I have identified any possibility to use this trick, I have experienced noticeable gains from it.

👉 Over to you: What other NN optimization techniques are you aware of?

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

Updated results on ARC AGI 2 ( [@arcprize](https://nitter.net/arcprize "ARC Prize") )

Ran my January 27th attempt on Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview by [@GoogleDeepMind](https://nitter.net/GoogleDeepMind "Google DeepMind")

Achieved 94.1% at $ 8.71/task. (reasoning set to high in OpenRouter)

Some key differences I noticed vs Claude Opus 4.6

\- Cheaper and uses less tokens overall.
\- Doesn't really abide by tool\_calling and tends to respond with text even when prompted to call tools in sequences.
\- API runs into errors when the model can't trace back on the reasoning trace (retry logic in code handles it)
\- No regressions vs opus! Gemini 3.1 Pro solved 11 tasks that were unsolved previously

Overall, the tool output traces show very deep understanding and ability to use code execution sandbox to understand when its approach is failing and update hypothesis.

btw if the new 99.1 day doubling time holds, this would imply ~144 hour or 6 day time horizons by end of year

with the pre-Opus-4.6 doubling time of ~105 days this would imply ~127 hours

My estimate was 11.26 hours with a doubling time of 103.6 days

It might be even slightly faster than this at ~99 days

but it's really hard to say, the confidence intervals are crazy

Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws over the weekend. The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)

I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.

Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.

Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.

Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.

Fair.
ML perspective is useful for sociology, I think more people must learn it on some level (avoiding quantum woo tier nonsense, hopefully).
"Mongolian", "Tibetan", even "Japanese" cultures Just Don't Scale. Only "Sinic" or "Western" cultures scale.

Mongolian and Tibetan culture and also Japanese are fundamentally opposed and hostile to Sinic culture despite mutual borrowings. It’s not the narcissism of small differences or merely nationalist sentiment these are mutually exclusive character types and visions of life

I am pessimistic on Taalas because I don't see how it scales to large contexts (read [@zephyr\_z9](https://nitter.net/zephyr_z9 "Zephyr") on memory). 60 ms to 1K completion with a 8B model is… neat? A neat parlor trick.
What \*would\* excite me is 17Kt/s for 2M tokens.
<2 minutes for 40 thoughts of 50K tokens each.

I'm super bullish on ACP.

As an engineer, this is your portal to building your own unique context management and control loops on top of agents.

I've essentially turned my editor into an agent-first IDE using this.

Lately, I've gotten super excited about [@zeddotdev](https://nitter.net/zeddotdev "Zed")'s open-source Agent Client Protocol. It's a fantastic way to pass a coding agent the exact context you're looking at in an IDE.

That's why as a pat leave side project I built my own ACP client to replace my Claude Code usage!

It's a few hundred lines of Python hooked up to a [@LangChain](https://nitter.net/LangChain "LangChain") Deep Agent with filesystem and shell access.

It works great out of the box, but the real power comes from customizing the internal agent to use whatever prompts, models, tools, skills etc. you want.

Plus, you get full observability via LangSmith!

I've been using it the past few weeks to great effect. See the links in the replies to try it yourself ⤵️

A mixture of tension, worry, unease, anticipation, and – almost delusion. Something huge is definitely happening right now. And the people who control the big companies certainly aren't hiding it.

Introducing DreamDojo, a generalist, interactive robot world model pretrained on 44k hours of human egocentric videos!

Scaling human data pretraining with the largest and most diverse dataset to date for robot world model learning, we achieve spectacular generalization to unseen object interactions and environments. Additionally, after distillation, DreamDojo achieves real-time generation at 10 FPS—you can watch it predict the future as actions stream online, one frame at a time! With these capabilities, we show several key applications: live teloperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning.

See our website: [dreamdojo-world.github.io](http://dreamdojo-world.github.io/)

Israel might be the only democracy in the Middle East, but then the US is the only Jewish theocracy in the West, with dignitaries regularly appealing to the Bible. amusing.
Huckabee is Scots-Irish btw. Reminds me of the schizo Anglo theory that Anglos are a lost Hebrew tribe

A typical progressives-more-correct moment btw. Jews as such are okay, the problem is that Hajnalis are bred to empower petty ethnocentrism. Polished the cocks of the pan-European ethny of nobles before, now starved and want to prostrate before another confident high-IQ minority.

Jews are just smarter-than-usual middle easterners, both on the individual and on the cultural level (Judaism + secular developments is better designed than the competition). Capable but normal human tribe.
Hajnalis are WEIRD and create bizarre outcomes in diverse societies

💰 Targets $284B in revenue in 2030, when it expects to become cash flow positive w/ ~$40B in cash
🖥️ Consumer ChatGPT + ads are main revenue drivers 💵Expects to burn $665B in computing costs through 2030

• Full architectural breakdown:
\- Gateway control plane
\- Scheduled reasoning
\- File-backed identity
\- Hybrid memory, etc.

• Lightweight alternatives you can actually run
• Practical use cases
• What the "local agent boom" really means

An Optimization Mindset says: “If I optimize every aspect of my life, then I’ll be happy.”

A Happiness Mindset says: “If I learn how to be happy, then I’ll naturally function in an optimal way.”

A Happiness Mindset ime outputs more happiness and, actually, more success in life

Joy is a competitive super power.

Alysa Liu retired from figure skating at 16.
She was tired of not not having fun, tired of being consumed by her sport.

She came back two years later with a new goal: to have as much fun on the ice as possible. And now she’s an Olympic gold medalist.

Liu won her first national title when she was just 13. But by 16, after competing in the 2022 Olympics, she decided she’d had enough and stepped away. She said pressure and losing her identity trying to be an elite athlete made it all miserable.

But then, she said she went on a ski trip that reminded her just how much fun she could have doing a sport. Something in her brain clicked. Maybe she could bring fun to figure skating. Maybe she could approach it in a way that could be full of joy and life and love.

She unretired at 18 and won a world championship the next year. At 20, she was ready to face these Olympic games differently than in 2022.

Liu went into the women’s figure skating final in third place. After her short program, she said:

“Even if I mess up and fall, that’s totally okay, too. I’m fine with any outcome, as long as I’m out there.”

One of the greatest competitive advantages is having fun. People love to romanticize the athlete, artist, or entrepreneur who has a chip on their shoulder, fueled by anger and resentment.

But the truth is that if you’re not having fun, you are not going to last long at whatever it is you do, and you certainly won’t get the best out of yourself. There’s a foolish idea that you either have to be full of intensity or full of joy. But that’s nonsense.

It’s no surprise one of the first things out of Alysa’s mouth after her free skate was: “That was so much fun!”

Joy and intensity can coexist, and in the best performers, they almost always do.

Alysa is unapologetically authentic and true to her values. She has said where she used to skate to win and be technically perfect, she now uses competition as a chance to show her art, to have fun, and to put herself out there.

She’s a fierce athlete with an infectious sense of joy in her sport.

And she broke USA's 24-year gold medal draught in women’s figure skating doing it.

Excellence requires focus, determination, a little bit of crazy, at times obsession, and living a mundane lifestyle that many people would find boring.

But excellence also requires that you find deep joy in your craft, that you learn how to have fun while working hard.

What makes for excellence—and not just in sports, but in anything—is the combination of intensity and joy. It’s the latter that makes the former sustainable.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

RLMs are exciting.

GPT-5.2-Codex might be one of the better models for RLMs.

These are tiny experiments, but exciting results so far.

I have a few interesting ideas about how I want to use RLMs for code, long-context tasks, and large-scale analysis.

More soon. Stay tuned!

By the way, the recent Gemini 3.1 Pro is also a really good model for RLMs.

Claude Opus 4.6 is the worst of the ones I tested. Probably not optimized for the type of decomposition that RLMs need.

I am just impressed by GPT-5.2-Codex. The strategies it uses are brilliant.

“Kevin. Let me see. I can’t see anything. I hear your voice but can’t seem to see anything “

Well, I'd like to see ol scaling wriggle its way out of THIS jam!

there's a narrow/broad church
\\* narrow: scaling is taking the exact same arch & training process and making it bigger.
\\* broad: scaling is putting more money into the AI lab box and expecting on-trend performance out the other side

i didn't realize when i started this company how much of my time would be spent writing docs/specs/one-pages/slide decks/etc. 🤣

i still get to do some coding here and there (especially thanks to claude code/codex) but luckily i have a great team building and executing quickly!

Taalas runs Llama 3 8B at 16k tokens per second per user. That's almost an order of magnitude increase even compared to SRAM-based systems like Cerebras.

Key idea: each chip is specialized to a given model. The chip is the model.

The chat demo is pretty wild:
