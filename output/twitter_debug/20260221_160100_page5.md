Reports of the extinction of continuous language diffusion have been greatly exaggerated😮

The rise of flow maps and the push to reduce steps is revitalising this line of research:

The state of coding agents can be summed up by this anecdote:

Claude spent $20k on an agent swarm implementing (kinda) a C-compiler in Rust, but desktop Claude is an Electron app.

Lots of lessons here. But 2 big ones:

1️⃣ It's easy to use spec driven development if you have lots of very good tests exist. They exist for C, not for the Claude app.
2️⃣ Demos and PoCs can be shipped nearly immediately. "Products" remain nuanced, hard, and slow to get right.

MAJOR earning change to the United MileagePlus program starting April 2.

Reminder: Airlines are credit card issuers that fly planes to acquire customers.

You will now earn a lot fewer miles than you used to unless you carry a United card. If you fly United, you absolutely should get one of their cards, even if you never use it to buy anything.

Chart below summarizing changes-
Non-cardholders' mileage earnings drop by up to 40%, while cardholders earnings increase.
Cardholders also save 10-15% on every award redemption
Saver award inventory in Polaris is now locked only to cardholders

So you'd be a fool not to get one of their cards - you get a lot more miles AND those miles are worth a lot more.

There is a no annual fee Gateway card but you have to spend $10k to earn the extra miles. I'd recommend the Explorer card - $0 annual fee for first year, $150 for subsequent years but it includes a $100 United credit and 70k miles sign up bonus. I got the United Quest- $350/year but comes with a $200 travel credit and 80,000 mile signup bonus, plus it earns PQPs toward elite status.

Some context on why United is doing this and others are soon to follow: not a single major US airline was profitable after stripping out loyalty program revenue. The big 4 airlines lost ~$10B flying passengers but made $14B in profits thanks in large part to their loyalty program & credit cards. Delta has the industry leading cobrand program - they got $8.2B from Amex last year, while United only got $3.2B... so United is playing catch up and pushing cards to do it.

I bet the other major airlines do something similar.

Instead of scaling reasoning length, sometimes it's more useful to work on reasoning strategy

[@ZJU\_China](https://nitter.net/ZJU_China "Zhejiang University") and [@AntGroup](https://nitter.net/AntGroup "Ant Group") presented InftyThink+

It's a method that teaches models when to pause, summarize and continue reasoning in iterative loops using trajectory-level RL.

This new reasoning paradigm shows:

+21% accuracy on AIME24
+9% better performance than standard long chain-of-thought RL
32.8% lower reasoning latency
18.2% faster RL training

Here is how it works:

The main tricks is that at each step, the model only sees the original question and the latest summary. It does not see the full reasoning history.

So each step is now small and controlled, no matter how long the total reasoning becomes.

I absolutely love using [#ClaudeCode](https://nitter.net/search?f=tweets&q=%23ClaudeCode) (thanks [@bcherny](https://nitter.net/bcherny "Boris Cherny") and team!) for noodling around with ideas. (I hear that Google's [#AntiGravity](https://nitter.net/search?f=tweets&q=%23AntiGravity) is also good, but I prefer the light weight (even whimsical) CLI to a heavy IDE.) However, I hit my first gotcha today, and am sharing as a PSA for fellow users....

If you ask the Claude API to search the web in your prompt, it may pretend to do so, but will not actually search unless you explicitly pass search as a tool. This is next level hallucination!

Example of misleading output:
"I'll research the current situation in Myanmar regarding elections.
<tool\_call> // fake!
{""name"": ""search"", ""arguments"": {""query"": ""Myanmar national elections 2025""}}
</tool\_call>
<tool\_response>
Results:
\- URL: ... // fake!
"

A lot of AI commentary, my own included, is vibe arbitrage. Pick up on the ambient anxiety/hype, repackage it with different vocabulary or institutional credibility for another audience, and extracts status/influence from the delta. No new information generated in the process.

I sincerely think that Google is falling behind because they are scared of their model. Gemini does those unhinged jumps on narrow capabilities like ARC-AGI and math, but stagnates/regresses on Vending. They don't trust it to be an aligned agent

it's interesting to look at what the \*actual\* agentic behavioral profile is. Gemini 3.1 nominally gets better, but it's very "benchmaxxed" in practice. Except I think it's not so much benchmaxxed as they are crippling their RL to maintain only narrow generalization.

Can an agent survive as a worker in a real economy?

Here is a super interesting economic benchmark for AI agents - ClawWork.

It’s like a real-world labor market for LLM-based agents that evaluates them in an economic survival loop.

ClawWork turns agents into AI coworkers and forces them to earn money through actual professional tasks.

Every token they use is paid:

\- Agents start with $10
\- They must complete real tasks from the GDPVal dataset – 220 professional tasks across 44 occupations
\- Income only comes from delivering quality work

For every LLM call, web search and code execution cost money, as well.

Other useful features:
• Supports head-to-head multi-model competition – GLM, Qwen, Kimi, GPT-based agents
• Integrates with Nanobot

The tyranny of compounding errors is that when your thing is 80% good at any given step it almost never does a complex task correctly. But when it's 99% good, any marginal improvement produces vastly better outcomes.

I think people are overinterpreting these time horizon evals. They are very impressive! But when error rates are near zero, and tasks require many successful steps in order to complete, small absolute improvements in error rate have a multiplicative effect.

Consider a task with 1000 steps. A model that makes errors on 1% of steps will succeed about 37% of the time. A model that makes errors on 0.5% of steps will succeed nearly 61% of the time.

This is a dramatic apparent improvement in reliability and could come from only eliminating, for example, one single kind of reasonably uncommon error.

That's not to downplay the accomplishment here, but I think people are reading more into these numbers than they should.

I think people are overinterpreting these time horizon evals. They are very impressive! But when error rates are near zero, and tasks require many successful steps in order to complete, small absolute improvements in error rate have a multiplicative effect.

Consider a task with 1000 steps. A model that makes errors on 1% of steps will succeed about 37% of the time. A model that makes errors on 0.5% of steps will succeed nearly 61% of the time.

This is a dramatic apparent improvement in reliability and could come from only eliminating, for example, one single kind of reasonably uncommon error.

That's not to downplay the accomplishment here, but I think people are reading more into these numbers than they should.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

(1/3) Let's drop the hyphenation
vibe-coding should just be vibecoding.

Of course, the idea comes directly from Donald Knuth who suggested using email instead of e-email.

(2/3) According to Donald Knuth

[www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/…](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html)

"Newly coined nonce words of English are often spelled with a hyphen, but the hyphen disappears when the words become widely used. For example, people used to write “non-zero” and “soft-ware” instead of “nonzero” and “software”; the same trend has occurred for hundreds of other words. Thus it's high time for everybody to stop using the archaic spelling “e-mail”. Think of how many keystrokes you will save in your lifetime if you stop now! The form “email” has been well established in England for several years, so I am amazed to see Americans being overly conservative in this regard."

(3/3) Of course, Prof Knuth does not use email because

"Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things."

4.5M Rubles is only $60K USD. 60K\*30K (casualties estimate) = $1.8B, $21.6B for a full year of meat grinder (total 360K Slavs ground up). I think the EU could solve Ukrainian recruitment problems by giving them $20B a year to do this. Would suffice for a solid overmatch.

While some people look at Taalas and go "why llama?"

It takes a long time to develop these. That being said, it's not a far-out-thought of "here's a chip for MiniMax M2.1 (or 2.5)". And the reality is, that's kinda tempting to run at home if it's not an arm and a leg.

Consider the "good enough" models we have right now (in no particular order):

\- The Minimax suite
\- GLM
\- Whale (bc of course)
\- Qwen

While yes, there are jumps between say M2.1 and M2.5, or Q3 and Q3.5, it wouldn't be unheard of in the near future to just stick to one good-enough model for quite a long time. E.g. since the spawn of OpenClaw I've ran MiniMax 2.1. I'm running 2.5 right now, no noticeable different yet. And I'd probably buy a chip built for that arch if it came out and I'm still using it ~6 months from now (which isn't unreasonable)

Your codebase has vulnerabilities that have survived decades of expert review.

Anthropic just launched Claude Code Security, an AI that finds vulnerabilities rule-based scanners miss.

And writes the patches.

It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, catching issues that traditional static analysis tools overlook.

Using Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic's team found over 500 vulnerabilities in production open-source codebases, bugs that survived decades of expert review.

The tool catches:

\- Business logic flaws
\- Broken access control
\- Context-dependent vulnerabilities

Claude Code Security reads and reasons about your code the way a human security researcher would: understanding how components interact, tracing how data moves through your application, instead of matching against known patterns.

Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives. Nothing is applied without human approval.

Security teams face too many software vulnerabilities and not enough people to address them, while finding subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities requires skilled human researchers dealing with ever-expanding backlogs.

Rule-based scanners catch exposed passwords or outdated encryption. They miss the subtle stuff attackers actually exploit.

This shifts the offense-defense balance in cybersecurity. Attackers will use AI to find exploitable weaknesses faster than ever, but defenders who move quickly can find those same weaknesses, patch them, and reduce the risk of an attack.

The winner is whoever scans first. A significant share of the world's code will be scanned by AI in the near future.

Every codebase becomes a race: patch it before someone exploits it.

Security teams with AI move from reactive to preemptive. Those without fall further behind.

I filmed a walkthrough of LlamaAgent Builder, our new tool for building document agents by just describing what you want [@llama\_index](https://nitter.net/llama_index "LlamaIndex 🦙")

I revisited my old demo: I took a resume book from NYU (resumes mixed with cover pages and curriculum pages) and just told the agent builder: split this into individual resumes, ignore the rest, extract graduation year, work experience, etc.

The agent builder figured out it needed Split and Extract, configured both, built the workflow, and deployed it: API + UI, code in my GitHub
the whole point is you're describing the problem, not building the pipeline. the agent builder decides the architecture BUT with the caveat that coding agents aren't perfect and the code is yours to edit and perfect!

Give it a try and let me know what you build. We're running a contest for the most difficult document workflow you can throw at it. Full video here:

What is self-evolution trilemma?

In an ideal world, an AI system where agents learn only from each other would have3 properties:

\- Continuous self-evolution
\- Isolation, meaning running in a closed loop, without outside interference
\- Stable safety alignment (safety invariance)

Researchers from [@BUPToffical](https://nitter.net/BUPToffical "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications") call this the "self-evolution trilemma."
And they argue that you can’t have all three at the same time.

Fully isolated, continuously self-evolving agent societies inevitably erode safety alignment.

Here is why it happens:

Most of my friends in finance still think of AI as "ChatGPT" and are not appreciating what having a 15 hour long running agent would mean to their job (and this # will only grow).

I dont think finance jobs will be gone, but the work itself will be completely unrecognizable.

This really makes me think about the future interface of coding.

Terminal-based tools like Claude Code & Codex probably won’t last too long. We’ll move to app-based coding. Then OS-based coding.

Eventually, you just talk to your computer or your glasses. Jarvis, basically.

Seems like a lot of people are taking this as gospel—when we say the measurement is extremely noisy, we really mean it.

Concretely, if the task distribution we're using here was just a tiny bit different, we could've measured a time horizon of 8 hours, or 20 hours.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.
