It might be even slightly faster than this at ~99 days

but it's really hard to say, the confidence intervals are crazy

After playing with Gemini 3.1 extensively -
I can say that design and gaming is pretty much all that it’s good for.

The model is pretty bad at following basic instructions and tool schema, and for most coding tasks - performing worst than open source models.

Which also raises the point benchmark numbers are not very useful at this point

Just added [@GeminiApp](https://nitter.net/GeminiApp "Google Gemini") 3.1 Pro to [@Base44](https://nitter.net/Base44 "Base44")

Gemini 3.1 Pro is really good for gaming and design workflows, and it's fast. If that's what you're building, this is your model.

\+ we're adding something a lot of you were asking for - you can now pick your AI model from the very first prompt. No more starting with a default and switching halfway through.

Checkout this Pokemon game I built with the new model, and let me know what you're building

Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries.

As the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

We just brought flow maps to language modeling for one-step sequence generation 💥

Discrete diffusion is not necessary -- continuous flows over one-hot encodings achieve SoTA performance and ≥8.3× faster generation 🔥

We believe this is a major step forward for discrete generative modeling and language modeling alike. 🚀

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

This new result makes my forecast from last month much too conservative (my median was ~24 hour 50% time horizons by EOY). It makes ~3-4 month doubling times and superexponential progress both seem more likely to me.

Last year, we noticed a gap between scores in our SWE-bench Verified runs and scores reported elsewhere. We’ve now updated our evaluation methodology. For most models, we’re seeing scores close to those reported by the original model developers.

Agents aren't just prompts & tools.

To build well, you need to understand the layers.

Build an AI Agent (From Scratch) is control loops, memory, & tooling.
Build a Multi-Agent System (From Scratch) by [@\_nerdai\_](https://nitter.net/_nerdai_ "nerdai") is distributed reasoning & collaboration patterns.

Together, they read less like competitors and more like a sequence.

Announcing DreamDojo: our open-source, interactive world model that takes robot motor controls and generates the future in pixels. No engine, no meshes, no hand-authored dynamics. It's Simulation 2.0. Time for robotics to take the bitter lesson pill.

Real-world robot learning is bottlenecked by time, wear, safety, and resets. If we want Physical AI to move at pretraining speed, we need a simulator that adapts to pretraining scale with as little human engineering as possible.

Our key insights: (1) human egocentric videos are a scalable source of first-person physics; (2) latent actions make them "robot-readable" across different hardware; (3) real-time inference unlocks live teleop, policy eval, and test-time planning \*inside\* a dream.

We pre-train on 44K hours of human videos: cheap, abundant, and collected with zero robot-in-the-loop. Humans have already explored the combinatorics: we grasp, pour, fold, assemble, fail, retry—across cluttered scenes, shifting viewpoints, changing light, and hour-long task chains—at a scale no robot fleet could match. The missing piece: these videos have no action labels. So we introduce latent actions: a unified representation inferred directly from videos that captures "what changed between world states" without knowing the underlying hardware. This lets us train on any first-person video as if it came with motor commands attached.

As a result, DreamDojo generalizes zero-shot to objects and environments never seen in any robot training set, because humans saw them first.

Next, we post-train onto each robot to fit its specific hardware. Think of it as separating "how the world looks and behaves" from "how this particular robot actuates." The base model follows the general physical rules, then "snaps onto" the robot's unique mechanics. It's kind of like loading a new character and scene assets into Unreal Engine, but done through gradient descent and generalizes far beyond the post-training dataset.

A world simulator is only useful if it runs fast enough to close the loop. We train a real-time version of DreamDojo that runs at 10 FPS, stable for over a minute of continuous rollout. This unlocks exciting possibilities:

\- Live teleoperation \*inside\* a dream. Connect a VR controller, stream actions into DreamDojo, and teleop a virtual robot in real time. We demo this on Unitree G1 with a PICO headset and one RTX 5090.
\- Policy evaluation. You can benchmark a policy checkpoint in DreamDojo instead of the real world. The simulated success rates strongly correlate with real-world results - accurate enough to rank checkpoints without burning a single motor.
\- Model-based planning. Sample multiple action proposals → simulate them all in parallel → pick the best future. Gains +17% real-world success out of the box on a fruit packing task.

We open-source everything!! Weights, code, post-training dataset, eval set, and whitepaper with tons of details to reproduce. DreamDojo is based on NVIDIA Cosmos, which is open-weight too.

2026 is the year of World Models for physical AI. We want you to build with us. Happy scaling!

Why You Need Users to Break Your AI Project

Your AI idea sounds perfect on paper.

Then real users show up.

The fastest way to improve your AI project is to let people break it early. Prototypes aren’t for impressing, they’re for revealing the truth.

Test small. Learn fast. Fix early.

Peter Thiel on what aliens would mean for our military technology:

“It’s not that they might be demons or angels— they must be demons or angels.”

“If you have faster than light travel, if you have warp drive— what you need to cover interstellar distances— what that means for military technology is that you can send weapons at warp speed, and they will hit you before you ever see them coming.”

“There is no defense against a warp speed weapon. You could take over the whole universe before anybody could see you coming.”

In theory, almost everyone agrees AI policy should be evidence-based.
In practice, science is messy and can sit uneasily with "yes/no" answers.

I helped run a big RCT on AI-biology risk. Here are five (meta) lessons from what I learned and where I think bio evals need to go:

Just so we’re clear… Howard Lutnik is the \*architect\* of Trump’s tariff plan. He’s the one who pushed Trump on these.

And at the EXACT SAME TIME that he was doing this, Lutnik’s sons \*\*who he appointed to take over his bank\*\* were betting the tariffs would be struck down and buying up refund rights at $0.25 on the dollar.

And now the government owes companies refunds… and depending on how many refund slips they are holding, the Lutnik’s bank could make BILLIONS of dollars.

There’s nothing else I can say about this that won’t catch me a permaban

2026 ai bubble is peaking itself right now: someone just dropped a new benchmark on claude skills and the result of their paper is actually insane

the paper explicitly states smaller models with skills beat larger models without them

a smaller model like claude 4.5 haiku equipped with high quality skills smokes a raw state of the art opus 4.5 model by about 6 percent (27.7 vs 22.0)

imagine getting sota level performance from a free model, its basically cheating, you just have to manually spoonfeed it a basic markdown file explaining how to do its job

all of you opus guys are dumb, you can literally spam haiku with skills and get things shipped in 5x lesser time and 0 cost

even wilder thing is that codex gpt 5.2 fails on the pareto frontier. codex burned massive compute and costs, just to get completely mogged by gemini 3 flash hitting maximum performance at a fraction of cash

i can believe skill engineering is now a valid, mathematically proven substitute for compute

over that, it says self generated skills provide zero benefit on average and show negative deltas on 16/84 tasks. if you give an agent more than 3 skills at once, it bloats its context and completely fails
