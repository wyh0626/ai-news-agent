The cost of sequencing the human genome has fallen from $100 million to under $100 in approximately 25 years. The same will happen with countless other diagnostic tests.

people don't get the «not x—y», huh
it is a subtle issue, admittedly. It's not about the sentence structure; it's about salient dichotomies. LLMs spam it because of post-training on fancy writing patterns from people like PG; often using borderline synonyms.

Instead of scaling reasoning length, sometimes it's more useful to work on reasoning strategy

[@ZJU\_China](https://nitter.net/ZJU_China "Zhejiang University") and [@AntGroup](https://nitter.net/AntGroup "Ant Group") presented InftyThink+

It's a method that teaches models when to pause, summarize and continue reasoning in iterative loops using trajectory-level RL.

This new reasoning paradigm shows:

+21% accuracy on AIME24
+9% better performance than standard long chain-of-thought RL
32.8% lower reasoning latency
18.2% faster RL training

Here is how it works:

Can an agent survive as a worker in a real economy?

Here is a super interesting economic benchmark for AI agents - ClawWork.

It’s like a real-world labor market for LLM-based agents that evaluates them in an economic survival loop.

ClawWork turns agents into AI coworkers and forces them to earn money through actual professional tasks.

Every token they use is paid:

\- Agents start with $10
\- They must complete real tasks from the GDPVal dataset – 220 professional tasks across 44 occupations
\- Income only comes from delivering quality work

For every LLM call, web search and code execution cost money, as well.

Other useful features:
• Supports head-to-head multi-model competition – GLM, Qwen, Kimi, GPT-based agents
• Integrates with Nanobot

What if a tiny AI could out-think a giant one by reasoning in loops instead of just getting bigger?

Researchers from HKUST, CASIA, and UC Santa Cruz present LoopViT just for that!

They built a "looped" transformer that reuses the same small set of weights over and over, creating an internal chain of thought. It even stops computing automatically when its predictions become certain.

This 18M-parameter model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming much larger 73M-parameter models on the challenging visual reasoning ARC-AGI benchmark.

I was debugging an SSL cert issue, which worked on curl but not in another client, and Claude kept insisting in disabling certificate checks. At one point, it said "I have exhausted all options, either disable checks or generate a new .pem".

I said "I didn't take you as a quitter" and then it debugged the issue for 40 minutes straight until it found the root cause, lol.

never before since GPT-OSS have I seen so much aura farming for a mid-tier open source model. Just drop the tech report already.
Tokenization for Indian languages works the same as for all other, you just train your tokenizer on the appropriate distribution.

Sarvam’s 105B model (and its smaller 2B sibling, Sarvam-1) solved a problem that global giants like OpenAI & DeepSeek ignored: the Tokenization Tax.

In most AI models, an Indian word like Namaste takes 4-8 tokens to process, while an English word takes only 1.4 & this makes AI 4x more expensive for us.

Sarvam built a custom tokenizer from the ground up that brought Indian language fertility down to 1.4 tokens/word, matching English for the first time in history. This is how 40 people outperformed others in local efficiency :)

today [@taalas\_inc](https://nitter.net/taalas_inc "Taalas Inc.") launched their HC1 asic that can inference 17k tok/s. Sure, it's a shitty 3.1 8B today which is a 1.5 year gap.

But read the details to the HC2 this winter, and do the math — this timeline will converge to 0 in the next 2 years.

Now that Taalas has blown up, I think people should read the PIM-GPT paper.
PIM-GPT leverages DRAM-based PIM designs for executing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in the DRAM chips, eliminating the need to move matrix data off-chip. Non-linear functions and data communication are supported by an ASIC.

NanoClaw fixes a couple complaints people have about OpenClaw - it's a minimal, hackable reproduction (700LOC), that uses Apple Containers for sandboxing/security.

currently using deepwiki codemaps to explore the codebase. highly recommend interactive learning with on-demand Q&A rather than reading someone else's interpretation of the code. the map is very much not the territory here.

NanoClaw, the lightweight alternative to Clawdbot / OpenClaw already reached 10.5K Github stars ⭐️

Compared with OpenClaw, NanoClaw’s specialty is simplicity plus OS level isolation.

\- Much smaller and manageable codebase, only 4K lines.
\- Runs in containers for security.
\- Connects to WhatsApp, has memory, scheduled jobs, and runs directly on Anthropic's Agents SDK
\- stores state in SQLite, runs scheduled jobs, and keeps each chat group isolated with its own memory file and its own Linux container so the agent only sees directories you explicitly mount.
\- its safety model leans on application controls like allowlists and pairing codes inside a shared Node process.

OpenClaw is built for broad multi channel coverage, while NanoClaw intentionally stays minimal so you customize by changing a small codebase instead of operating a big framework.

The imagined fear is that China’s military will send a billion humanoid robots marching through the streets and overpower U.S. Army...

That’s probably fighting the last war in our heads.

The real fear is something different.

A new kind of war fought over the internet, where you influence populations, hack infrastructure, and destabilize societies. That feels much more plausible.

It’s wrong and unfair to say Anthropic has no strategy.

They absolutely do. The strategy is relentless focus on coding, since they believe it’s the path to AGI. They say no to image models, no to video models.

Claude Code, MCP, and Cowork weren’t random “side projects.”

He just told you everything you need to know in one sentence and I am not sure he realizes it.

“Fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”

Legally tested. This statute has never been invoked in 51 years. It has never been litigated. It has never survived a single judicial challenge. There is zero case law. Not one ruling. Not one circuit opinion. Not one district court order. The words “legally tested” are doing work that no courtroom has ever done.

Now the math. 15% is not a policy choice. It is the statutory ceiling. Section 122 caps the surcharge at 15% ad valorem. He did not raise the tariff to 15%. He maxed out the only tool he has left. There is no 20%. There is no 25%. There is no escalation. The leverage is gone because the ceiling is the floor and the floor expires in 150 days.

And here is what makes it worse. Indonesia signed its deal at 19%. India negotiated 18%. Both rates are now impossible to honor because the statute physically cannot go that high. He just told every country in the world that the enforcement mechanism behind their bilateral agreement is capped below the rate they agreed to.

“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs.”

Read that again. He is openly admitting Section 122 is a stopgap. He is telling you the replacement for the replacement has not been determined yet. The 150-day clock is running and the next instrument does not exist.

The IEEPA tariffs had no cap, no expiration, and country-specific rates. The replacement has a hard cap he just hit, a hard expiration in July, and cannot discriminate by country.

He went from unlimited to maximum in 24 hours and called it a victory.

The clocks do not read Truth Social.

That gap between the headline and the mechanism is the most mispriced risk in global markets right now.

Here is what actually died on February 20. Not a tariff rate. The capacity of the executive branch to offer country-specific concessions in exchange for investment commitments. Japan committed $550 billion for a 15% IEEPA rate. South Korea pledged $350 billion. The EU accepted $750 billion in procurement. Indonesia signed its deal on February 19, literally the day before the ruling.

Every one of those deals was anchored to legal authority that six Supreme Court justices just declared never existed.

The replacement is Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. It has never been invoked in its 51-year history. It was designed for a fixed-exchange-rate monetary system that ended in 1973. It expires in 150 days. And it cannot discriminate by country, which means the bilateral deal architecture is structurally dead.

Six clocks are now converging on the same window. Section 122 expires July 24. USMCA six-year review triggers July 1. The Section 232 investigation pipeline races against both. China's rare earth suspension lifts in November. DFARS prohibits Chinese-origin critical minerals in defense systems January 1, 2027. Midterms force every Republican onto the record on tariff codification.

The market is pricing a steady-state replacement. The mechanism says it is a 150-day fuse attached to six simultaneous detonators. No single analyst covers trade law, defense procurement, rare earth geopolitics, Fed confirmation politics, and midterm electoral dynamics simultaneously. That is why the convergence is invisible.

Meanwhile, gold is above $5,000 and central banks purchased 863 tonnes in 2025. Bitcoin is down 40 to 50% from its all-time highs. The entities that actually constitute the monetary system chose atoms over promises. The verification cost inversion thesis is empirically dead.

The consensus is not wrong about any single variable. It is wrong about the interaction effects. And the clocks do not care about consensus.

Full analysis in today's publication.

\> ~3000 calories per day
all of this mafs is very silly in the MoE era, but first things first: is the energy cost of a human just 3K kalories/day?
I'm, like, running an AC here. That's maybe 12 kWh/day. There's transport, there's logistics, \*making stuff\*…

~3000 calories per day = 22m calories in 20 years =~ 25k kw - assume 10x inefficiency in production = 250k kw ~ assume 10 kw per hour to run a 8x H100 machine = 25k\*8 = 200k gpu hours

llama3 8b took 1.3m gpu hours (~6 people), 405b took 31m (~150 people)

this doesn't count all the experiments leading up to the run - likely 10-100x the cost

Why has Trump not initiated a lawsuit or even acknowledged this?

Because he knows it’s true. He knows if he ever brought this to a court room it would be certified as an a solute undeniable fact.

The United States opposes any efforts to incorporate European preference in the EU Defense Procurement Directive. We fully support European rearmament and a revitalization of the European defense industrial base.  However, European preference in the Directive would undermine member state flexibility to make national procurement purchases, hinder European rearmament efforts, create barriers for Allies reaching NATO capability targets, and run counter to European commitments in the 2025 U.S.-EU Joint Statement on trade and Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreements.

New Google paper challenges how we measure LLM reasoning.

Token count is a poor proxy for actual reasoning quality.

There might be a better way to measure this.

This work introduces "deep-thinking tokens," a metric that identifies tokens where internal model predictions shift significantly across deeper layers before stabilizing.

These tokens capture "genuine reasoning" effort rather than verbose output.

Instead of measuring how much a model writes, measure how hard it's actually thinking at each step. Deep-thinking tokens are identified by tracking prediction instability across transformer layers during inference.

The ratio of deep-thinking tokens correlates more reliably with accuracy than token count or confidence metrics across mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, GPQA-diamond), tested on DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, and GPT-OSS.

They also introduce Think@n, a test-time compute strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios while early-rejecting low-quality partial outputs, reducing cost without sacrificing performance.

Why does it matter?

As inference-time scaling becomes a primary lever for improving model performance, we need better signals than token length to understand when a model is actually reasoning versus just rambling.

The maximalist form of my thesis is basically this: SaaS is not about code, it is about solving a problem customers have and selling them the solution. Services + sales. If the cost of code goes to \*zero\*, SaaS will \*not\* go away. It will \*benefit\*, since code is a cost center.

Running 24/7 without any human babysitters has been really hard

We want robots operating at all times - even at 2am, on weekends, or on Christmas Day

The robots run until their battery is low. When one heads to dock for recharging, a second robot receives a message to leave the dock and make room for the incoming robot. The first robot then autonomously docks. By the time the first robot is charging, the second is already back to work

We never want downtime. If a robot has an issue, it goes to a triage area to dock while a replacement robot swaps in from another area. This could be due to a hardware or software issue

The robots dock onto a wireless inductive charger built into their feet. They step onto a pad that charges them via coils in their feet at up to 2 kW. It takes about an hour to fully charge at roughly a 1C rate

We’re now up and running across many different use cases like this. Crazy to see it

Rain or shine, the machines don’t sleep. Figure robots operate autonomously, 24/7
