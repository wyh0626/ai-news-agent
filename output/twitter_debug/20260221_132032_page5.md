Your codebase has vulnerabilities that have survived decades of expert review.

Anthropic just launched Claude Code Security, an AI that finds vulnerabilities rule-based scanners miss.

And writes the patches.

It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, catching issues that traditional static analysis tools overlook.

Using Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic's team found over 500 vulnerabilities in production open-source codebases, bugs that survived decades of expert review.

The tool catches:

\- Business logic flaws
\- Broken access control
\- Context-dependent vulnerabilities

Claude Code Security reads and reasons about your code the way a human security researcher would: understanding how components interact, tracing how data moves through your application, instead of matching against known patterns.

Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives. Nothing is applied without human approval.

Security teams face too many software vulnerabilities and not enough people to address them, while finding subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities requires skilled human researchers dealing with ever-expanding backlogs.

Rule-based scanners catch exposed passwords or outdated encryption. They miss the subtle stuff attackers actually exploit.

This shifts the offense-defense balance in cybersecurity. Attackers will use AI to find exploitable weaknesses faster than ever, but defenders who move quickly can find those same weaknesses, patch them, and reduce the risk of an attack.

The winner is whoever scans first. A significant share of the world's code will be scanned by AI in the near future.

Every codebase becomes a race: patch it before someone exploits it.

Security teams with AI move from reactive to preemptive. Those without fall further behind.

We built a vibe-coding tool to help you accurately extract out information from any document type, simply by describing the workflow in natural language.

In the latest walkthrough, [@tuanacelik](https://nitter.net/tuanacelik "Tuana") shows you how to split a package of resumes and extract out candidate information from every single resume, simply by describing the task in English.

Our agent builder is built on top of LlamaParse. It’s available today - come check it out! [cloud.llamaindex.ai/](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/)

I filmed a walkthrough of LlamaAgent Builder, our new tool for building document agents by just describing what you want [@llama\_index](https://nitter.net/llama_index "LlamaIndex 🦙")

I revisited my old demo: I took a resume book from NYU (resumes mixed with cover pages and curriculum pages) and just told the agent builder: split this into individual resumes, ignore the rest, extract graduation year, work experience, etc.

The agent builder figured out it needed Split and Extract, configured both, built the workflow, and deployed it: API + UI, code in my GitHub
the whole point is you're describing the problem, not building the pipeline. the agent builder decides the architecture BUT with the caveat that coding agents aren't perfect and the code is yours to edit and perfect!

Give it a try and let me know what you build. We're running a contest for the most difficult document workflow you can throw at it. Full video here:

What is self-evolution trilemma?

In an ideal world, an AI system where agents learn only from each other would have3 properties:

\- Continuous self-evolution
\- Isolation, meaning running in a closed loop, without outside interference
\- Stable safety alignment (safety invariance)

Researchers from [@BUPToffical](https://nitter.net/BUPToffical "Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications") call this the "self-evolution trilemma."
And they argue that you can’t have all three at the same time.

Fully isolated, continuously self-evolving agent societies inevitably erode safety alignment.

Here is why it happens:

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

This really makes me think about the future interface of coding.

Terminal-based tools like Claude Code & Codex probably won’t last too long. We’ll move to app-based coding. Then OS-based coding.

Eventually, you just talk to your computer or your glasses. Jarvis, basically.

OpenAI claims GPT-5.2 made a breakthrough in theoretical physics. Reactions ranged from "physics will never be the same" to "it's just a calculator"

Seems like a lot of people are taking this as gospel—when we say the measurement is extremely noisy, we really mean it.

Concretely, if the task distribution we're using here was just a tiny bit different, we could've measured a time horizon of 8 hours, or 20 hours.

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

After playing with Gemini 3.1 extensively -
I can say that design and gaming is pretty much all that it’s good for.

The model is pretty bad at following basic instructions and tool schema, and for most coding tasks - performing worst than open source models.

Which also raises the point benchmark numbers are not very useful at this point

Checkout this Pokemon game I built with the new model, and let me know what you're building

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries.

As the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research.

We just brought flow maps to language modeling for one-step sequence generation 💥

Discrete diffusion is not necessary -- continuous flows over one-hot encodings achieve SoTA performance and ≥8.3× faster generation 🔥

We believe this is a major step forward for discrete generative modeling and language modeling alike. 🚀

To continue upper-bounding the autonomy of AI agents, and developing evaluations for monitoring AI systems and their propensity to subvert human control, we need more great engineering and research staff. Please apply below or DM me!

We estimate that Claude Opus 4.6 has a 50%-time-horizon of around 14.5 hours (95% CI of 6 hrs to 98 hrs) on software tasks. While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.

NVIDIA’s CuTe layouts are gaining traction. I wanted to see why everyone loves them. The basics were easy, but intermediate resources beyond matrix algebra were scarce. So I wrote a blog post sharing my journey, building up to a GEMM kernel that can beat cuBLAS 🧵

This new result makes my forecast from last month much too conservative (my median was ~24 hour 50% time horizons by EOY). It makes ~3-4 month doubling times and superexponential progress both seem more likely to me.

Last year, we noticed a gap between scores in our SWE-bench Verified runs and scores reported elsewhere. We’ve now updated our evaluation methodology. For most models, we’re seeing scores close to those reported by the original model developers.

Agents aren't just prompts & tools.

To build well, you need to understand the layers.

Build an AI Agent (From Scratch) is control loops, memory, & tooling.
Build a Multi-Agent System (From Scratch) by [@\_nerdai\_](https://nitter.net/_nerdai_ "nerdai") is distributed reasoning & collaboration patterns.

Together, they read less like competitors and more like a sequence.
