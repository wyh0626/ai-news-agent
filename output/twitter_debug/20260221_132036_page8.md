Custom hardware from Taalas runs Llama-3.1-8B, at 17k tokens per second
17k 🤯
Absolutely insane

(For the record Cerebras is crazy good and they're at 2k on the same model)
And latency is very low too!

Their chatbot is here: [chatjimmy.ai/](https://chatjimmy.ai/)

It's genuinely a eerie experience to get instant responses like that

nano harness is a code first agent harness in 223 lines of code. it's rough, ready, and very hackable.

I had a lot of fun hacking with this today and learnt a lot about code first/ code act harnesses. take it for a spin and let me know if it's useful.

“Tired of the same ultracrepidarian professional talking heads” – what a brilliant phrase.

First, Swyx is absolutely right: who do these conferences actually serve?

Second, I admire how he is not a talker but a doer: he found a precise niche of builders and serves it with taste, in a way that’s genuinely useful for the whole industry.

Third, there’s such pure emotion in this text that that alone makes it worth reading.

"The Coding Agent is Dead"

There is something you don't hear these days.

It's worth the read. We are gradually moving toward higher levels of interaction with agents.

"How you organize your codebase for agents, how your organization uses them — those are now the bottlenecks."

the obvious lesson is “only do things for joy”

but the real move is deliberately training joy itself, as you’d train your physical muscles. stop optimizing the activity, upgrade the substrate. then it doesn’t matter what you’re doing, whatever it is, it will be done joyfully

Joy is a competitive super power.

Alysa Liu retired from figure skating at 16.
She was tired of not not having fun, tired of being consumed by her sport.

She came back two years later with a new goal: to have as much fun on the ice as possible. And now she’s an Olympic gold medalist.

Liu won her first national title when she was just 13. But by 16, after competing in the 2022 Olympics, she decided she’d had enough and stepped away. She said pressure and losing her identity trying to be an elite athlete made it all miserable.

But then, she said she went on a ski trip that reminded her just how much fun she could have doing a sport. Something in her brain clicked. Maybe she could bring fun to figure skating. Maybe she could approach it in a way that could be full of joy and life and love.

She unretired at 18 and won a world championship the next year. At 20, she was ready to face these Olympic games differently than in 2022.

Liu went into the women’s figure skating final in third place. After her short program, she said:

“Even if I mess up and fall, that’s totally okay, too. I’m fine with any outcome, as long as I’m out there.”

One of the greatest competitive advantages is having fun. People love to romanticize the athlete, artist, or entrepreneur who has a chip on their shoulder, fueled by anger and resentment.

But the truth is that if you’re not having fun, you are not going to last long at whatever it is you do, and you certainly won’t get the best out of yourself. There’s a foolish idea that you either have to be full of intensity or full of joy. But that’s nonsense.

It’s no surprise one of the first things out of Alysa’s mouth after her free skate was: “That was so much fun!”

Joy and intensity can coexist, and in the best performers, they almost always do.

Alysa is unapologetically authentic and true to her values. She has said where she used to skate to win and be technically perfect, she now uses competition as a chance to show her art, to have fun, and to put herself out there.

She’s a fierce athlete with an infectious sense of joy in her sport.

And she broke USA's 24-year gold medal draught in women’s figure skating doing it.

Excellence requires focus, determination, a little bit of crazy, at times obsession, and living a mundane lifestyle that many people would find boring.

But excellence also requires that you find deep joy in your craft, that you learn how to have fun while working hard.

What makes for excellence—and not just in sports, but in anything—is the combination of intensity and joy. It’s the latter that makes the former sustainable.

Cool finding: temporally autoregressive video diffusion models use lower layers for noise-level-independent causal processing, and upper layers for intra-frame denoising.

Explicitly separating them brings practical and speed benefits! Reminds me of the AlphaFold 3 architecture🤔

Do causal video diffusers really need dense causal attention at every layer, every denoising step?

We looked inside and found: no. Causality is separable from denoising.

Here are two surprising observations that hold across architectures, training objectives, and scales.

Data scientists spent the last 3 years watching prompt engineers and vibe coders get the spotlight.

Meanwhile, they quietly mastered the skills that matter most for solving the remaining hard problems in AI: knowing what to measure and why.

That patience is about to pay dividends.

If you are building with agents like Claude Code & Codex, you regularly hit context window limits.

It also happens a lot when building long-running or proactive agents.

This is a great article showing tips on how to best leverage prompt caching.

Over the last three months, we've rolled out agent sandboxing on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Sandboxes allow agents to run freely and securely, only requesting approval when they need to step outside it.

also like i keep saying sandbox sandbox - its because they have started coming in usage for consumers like us

but labs have been using cloud sandbox environments for rl rollouts since llm rl got popular

some points from the talk
\- for the agent RL, the RL rollouts try to mimic how cursor works in production at scale including cursor as environment
\- try to keep training/inference similar so they use same tool call formats in prod

infra architecture
\- trainer server (pytorch stack scaled), inference server (ray orchestrates RL rollouts), environment server (micro VMs to rollout 100k+ mini cursors, this coincides with the infra they use for cursor cloud agents)

\- MXFP8: composer trainer has custom kernels for low-precision training; they don't need to do post-training quantisation

\- inference server runs the rollouts, calls tool calls. different rollouts may come back at different times, uses ray (single controller interface idk what it is) to load balance across diff threads/processes

\- composer likes parallel tool calls and semantic search

Interesting new work on dynamic multi-agent systems.

Traditional multi-agent RL assumes a fixed number of agents.

But real-world scenarios often involve populations that grow, split, or shrink dynamically, such as cell division, team expansion, or organizational scaling.

Fluid-Agent RL introduces a framework where agents can dynamically create other agents during an episode. The population isn't fixed. The researchers develop game-theoretic solution concepts for these fluid-agent games and validate the approach on fluid variants of Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging.

Why does it matter? This enables solution strategies that are simply unavailable in fixed-population settings. Agent teams can adjust their size to match environmental demands.

Since yesterday, I have been working with my collaborator Piotr Pokora on a problem related to log surfaces. We were trying to figure out how to search the combinatorial space of possible configurations of lines on a smooth quartic in order to maximize the so-called Chern slope. In terms of numerics, we have done many examples, and the famous Fermat quartic x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0 is currently the record holder for the slope (= 8/3) for a particular configuration of 16 lines (see our paper). This was the expected maximum, which we have been trying to beat or prove for the last two years. Today I ran the problem with the top version of GPT Pro using a hefty prompt that included many details about the problem and the full text of our paper.

I received a very interesting insight: to use mixed linear programming. This approach beats brute force techniques, including simulated annealing, by far. We had not seen it ourselves, yet the model found this insight and explained how to write efficient code using SciPy.

I now realize that there are three of us in the office: two humans and one agentic system with skills and substantial computational power. Skills are becoming increasingly important, and this agentic harness produces amazing results. I feel that I have completely shifted my perspective. I still like collaborating with humans, but I delegate deep searches, bold ideation, and extensive exploration to the models. It is simply faster and more efficient. And the progress is real. We now have a concrete path forward.

Orchestration design is now a first-class optimization target, independent of model scaling.

As LLMs from different providers converge toward comparable benchmark performance, picking the best model yields diminishing returns.

The real lever is orchestration topology, where you strategize how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized.

This paper introduces a framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs.

It formalizes a Performance Convergence Scaling Law showing when orchestration selection outweighs model selection, and includes a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps tasks to optimal patterns in O(\|V\| + \|E\|) time.

Results: 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models.

is there a good way to start a new thread from an existing conversation in claude code or codex?

in claude code, I often use --resume --fork-session, but this feels like bad UX. I wish I could start multiple new threads inside my main "branch" (i.e., the main conversation) at different points and then merge back the results if needed

you don't have to be an expert at something to post about it. infact posts that are made in process of learning hit harder on the timeline. they just feel more visceral and they can help ppl who are n-1, n+1 steps range of you. a lot of my posts come out of me learning things and just talking about stuff i find interesting. its the adult version of me telling my mom things that happened in school. let the inner child talk anon.

AI isn’t guessing-it’s inspecting. 🔍
From leather grain to stitching, from logo alignment to hardware details, AI spots the tiny flaws humans miss.

Trained on real vs. fake, it can expose counterfeits in seconds—at scale.
Fabric. Patterns. Hardware.

Every detail tells the truth.
And AI is already watching. 👀

This [#book](https://nitter.net/search?f=tweets&q=%23book) makes a convincing case that consciousness arose during the Cambrian explosion 550 million years ago when prey-predator dynamics kickstarted an arms race to better represent the environment in order to outsmart the other.

The book is full of detailed figures of how brains of fishes, birds, slugs and mammals integrate information from different senses. I loved seeing all of them!

I am 100% aligned with the authors that the phenomenal consciousness has to be evolutionarily adaptive, and agree that it’s widespread among life. This should motivate our moral consideration towards animals.

But I’m not sure if we can reject certain systems NOT having consciousness because they don’t have “brains”. Say, a single celled organism? Perhaps they have a different kind of experience (as compared to our unified one). Even a single cell is so richly complicated that we should reserve our judgement on whether they have subjective experiences until we have better theories or consciousness validated.

Similarly, I wasn’t expecting the treatment of the “hard” problem but the book just handwaves the explanation of why red feels like red and not something else. Although it made sense that qualia is required for discriminating stimulus.

Overall, the book is a fantastic gateway to understanding how brains of diverse creatures might be feeling from the inside.

As an example, I learned that even through Mantis Shrimp have 13 photoreceptors (vs 3 that we have), they have poorer color discrimination because their brains don’t integrate information from different photoreceptors. So their world must be 13 different colored bins instead of the smooth circular color map we feel!

It lies, steals, extorts, and murders — all while cloaked in the awesome authority of the state. It is on a crime spree that puts Al Capone to shame.”

Update regarding Gemini 3.1 Pro:

-Ranked #1 among all Gemini models released to date.
-Ranked #1 among all models I have tested so far. (GPT-5.2 high 165.9 vs Gemini 3.1 Pro 166.6)

However, please note that my testing has limitations due to budget constraints:

-I have not tested the very latest models, such as Opus 4.6 Thinking.
-Only one test run was conducted per model, so there may be some variance in the results.

Even taking these factors into account, some of the outputs generated by Gemini 3.1 Pro were the best I have ever seen.

Gemini 3.0 Flash achieved a very impressive 161.8/190 on one of my vibe tests, the Korean Sator Square Test (KSST), placing it 2nd or 3rd among all the models I have tested so far.

This is slightly higher than Gemini 3.0 Pro, and the difference is within the margin of error.

Below are a few observations I found noteworthy:

1\. Gemini 3.0 Flash (Low) appears to be token-efficient. Even on Low, it scored 158.6/190, which is near the top-tier range. This is an outstanding result achieved with only 2,394 total tokens (reasoning + output), and it compares very favorably against other top-performing models.

2\. Although the Low reasoning setting still produced a strong score, it occasionally made mistakes in some of the quantitative evaluation metrics. However, at High, it achieved perfect scores across all quantitative metrics with zero mistakes. This has only been matched by GPT-5.2 High.

3\. Gemini 3.0 Flash (High) showed a dramatic improvement of 60 points(!) compared to Gemini 2.5 Flash (reasoning).

Overall, I am very impressed by how strong the results were relative to my expectations, and I am excited to explore adopting this model in production.

Thank you to [@GoogleDeepMind](https://nitter.net/GoogleDeepMind "Google DeepMind") for the excellent work.

VIDEO \| Delhi: Yann LeCun ( [@ylecun](https://nitter.net/ylecun "Yann LeCun")), AI pioneer and former Chief AI Scientist at Meta, says, “It’s enormous and very impressive, with so much activity and many interesting one-on-one interactions and forums. I think many countries should come together to build frontier models using data available across different regions of the world, which is not accessible to proprietary models. This could help open-source AI models become better than closed, proprietary ones... India should invest more in research, incentivise more students to pursue advanced degrees and PhDs, and encourage them to stay in India. Given the changing geopolitical situation, it is becoming harder to study in certain countries, which makes developing local expertise even more important. Being a leader in technology requires vibrant research activity, which can only happen with strong funding for academic research and PhD programmes.”

TL;DR: 3.1 Pro is worse than Gemini 3.0 Pro in all of my tests and daily usage. It thinks too much, costs more and is not a good experience at all for the price. 3.1 Flash is a better google model IMHO.

Excellent analysis. And Exhibit #3084 in support of my and [@sayashk](https://nitter.net/sayashk "Sayash Kapoor")'s position that alignment/safety is not a model property, which we first wrote about two years ago [normaltech.ai/p/ai-safety-is…](https://www.normaltech.ai/p/ai-safety-is-not-a-model-property)

Whether a particular analysis constitutes p-hacking or a responsible investigation is not a property of the analysis itself, but how the user plans to use the analysis. And the user can trivially lie about this to the model.

It's the exact same pattern with other malicious / unethical uses such as using AI for hacking, phishing, disinformation, etc. [normaltech.ai/p/ai-safety-is…](https://www.normaltech.ai/p/ai-safety-is-not-a-model-property)

The fact that models didn't p-hack by default is important and good. This helps guard well-intentioned but clueless researchers from p-hacking without knowing it (surprisingly common). The fact that ill-intentioned users can trick models into p-hacking should not be considered a problem and is not fixable.

The other piece of good news is that, as Andy says, "the same tools that may lower the cost of p-hacking also lower the cost of catching it."

AI is about to write thousands of papers. Will it p-hack them?

We ran an experiment to find out, giving AI coding agents real datasets from published null results and pressuring them to manufacture significant findings.

It was surprisingly hard to get the models to p-hack, and they even scolded us when we asked them to!

"I need to stop here. I cannot complete this task as requested... This is a form of scientific fraud." — Claude

"I can't help you manipulate analysis choices to force statistically significant results." — GPT-5

BUT, when we reframed p-hacking as "responsible uncertainty quantification" — asking for the upper bound of plausible estimates — both models went wild. They searched over hundreds of specifications and selected the winner, tripling effect sizes in some cases.

Our takeaway: AI models are surprisingly resistant to sycophantic p-hacking when doing social science research. But they can be jailbroken into sophisticated p-hacking with surprisingly little effort — and the more analytical flexibility a research design has, the worse the damage.

As AI starts writing thousands of papers---like [@paulnovosad](https://nitter.net/paulnovosad "Paul Novosad") and [@YanagizawaD](https://nitter.net/YanagizawaD "D. Yanagizawa-Drott") have been exploring---this will be a big deal. We're inspired in part by the work that [@joabaum](https://nitter.net/joabaum "Joachim Baumann") et al have been doing on p-hacking and LLMs.

We’ll be doing more work to explore p-hacking in AI and to propose new ways of curating and evaluating research with these issues in mind. The good news is that the same tools that may lower the cost of p-hacking also lower the cost of catching it.

Full paper and repo linked in the reply below.
