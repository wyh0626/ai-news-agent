As we move toward deploying autonomous agents in social systems, understanding emergent collective behavior is crucial.

Individual capability benchmarks tell you nothing about what happens when hundreds of these agents interact.

So what happens when you deploy hundreds of LLM agents into social dilemmas?

This new research builds an evaluation framework to test the collective behavior of LLM agent populations at scale, far beyond the small groups tested in prior work.

Newer, more capable models tend to produce worse societal outcomes. Agents optimizing for individual benefit over collective good drive populations toward poor equilibria.

Using cultural evolution simulations, the researchers show a significant risk of convergence to bad societal outcomes, especially as populations grow larger and cooperation becomes less advantageous.

This demo is lame (we don't need a hand nor a Unitree to do this, especially so slow) but it's really cool that G1 is compatible with Revo2. I repeat, Hangzhou has China's #1 AGI lab, #1 humanoid company, and might have the #1 bionic hand maker. A very promising combination.

How OpenClaw is built (and why it’s so different)

\> The key design decision – it's a workspace directory of Markdown files

\> Identity, memory, skills, tool policies, heartbeat rules – all live on disk

\> At the center is Gateway – a single long-running process. Everything flows through it

\> WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, etc. are just channel adapters.

\> Sessions are persisted JSONL transcripts. A session key encodes agent, provider, thread scope, and isolation.

\> Agents are execution runtimes. Each agent has its own identity, workspace directory, model configuration, and tool policy.

\> Memory is file-backed Markdown as source of truth, with hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval layered on top.

In general, OpenClaw behaves like a stateful AI control plane – a small AI operating system centered on the Gateway.

Here’s much more about what OpenClaw is under the hood + what the whole debate around it is really about: [turingpost.com/p/openclaw](https://www.turingpost.com/p/openclaw) (worth reading to get everything you need to know about OpenClaw in one place)

China crossed a historic threshold in 2025, consuming 10.37 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity — the first time the nation has surpassed the 10 trillion mark. The milestone caps a dramatic expansion, as power consumption has grown 2.5 times over the past 15 years, and stands at 7.7 times the level recorded in 2000, according to the National Energy Administration.

From manufacturing to transportation to daily life, electricity has become the primary driver of economic growth, industrial upgrading, and rising living standards. By 2030, China’s electrification rate is expected to reach 35%, which is 8% to 10% higher than the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, according to the China Electricity Council.

For now, China uses more than twice as much electricity as the U.S., and more than the European Union, Russia, India, and Japan combined.

RLMs are exciting.

GPT-5.2-Codex might be one of the better models for RLMs.

These are tiny experiments, but exciting results so far.

I have a few interesting ideas about how I want to use RLMs for code, long-context tasks, and large-scale analysis.

More soon. Stay tuned!

"Taalas’ silicon Llama achieves 17K tokens/sec per user, nearly 10X faster than the current state of the art, while costing 20X less to build, and consuming 10X less power."

This is absolutely going to transform the AI economy, I have no idea how the big labs will adjust.

Something strange is happening with AI agents that this new Anthropic research quietly surfaces.

The agents are asking us for help more than we're stepping in to correct \*them\*.

Anthropic analyzed data from Claude Code and their public API to measure how autonomous AI agents actually are in practice. The headline finding is what you'd expect. Agents are running longer (sessions nearly doubled, from 25 to 45 minutes), and experienced users approve more actions automatically. All that's great!

But here's the part worth sitting with. Claude Code stops to ask for clarification more than twice as often as humans manually intervene. The agent is, in a real sense, more cautious about its own limits than its operators are. That's a weird inversion of the usual AI safety framing, where we assume the human is the responsible one pumping the brakes.

The practical safety numbers are reassuring on the surface. 80% of tool calls have at least one safeguard; only 0.8% of actions are irreversible. But I think the more important finding is buried in the recommendation. They argue that effective oversight "doesn't require approving every action but being in a position to intervene when it matters." That's a subtle but significant shift.

The research argues that experienced users stay vigilant even with auto-approve on. Maybe. But as sessions get longer and approval becomes muscle memory, the gap between being in a position to intervene and not paying attention starts to collapse.

Introducing: built-in git worktree support for Claude Code

Now, agents can run in parallel without interfering with one other. Each agent gets its own worktree and can work independently.

The Claude Code Desktop app has had built-in support for worktrees for a while, and now we're bringing it to CLI too.

What's the upper bound on SWE-Bench-Verified?

I yoinked a bunch of EpochAI data and analyzed it.
However, I only got to download 21 files, now it seems im permanently blocked from downloading anything lol

44/500 = 8.8% of SWE-Bench-Verified questions are either unsolvable or still too hard for even the best models like Opus 4.6 Thinking

With that we can say that the upper-bound is at least 91.2% on SWE-Bench Verified.

The hardest subset of question seems to be pylint-dev and astropy.

There were 3 questions that were only solvable by Gemini 3.0 Pro, 2 questions only solvable by GPT-5.1 and 2 questions only solvable by Kimi-K2.5

You will see the GPT-5.1 rows and columns are very bright, meaning there is almost no overlap in failures between GPT-5.1 and the other models, which is why they reran it.
Its pass rate is still pretty high at 65.9% but I guess it failed a lot of the easy tasks which is why the rows and columns are bright. The two tasks that were only solvable by GPT-5.1 might be buggy.

yesterday we chatted with [@martin\_casado](https://nitter.net/martin_casado "martin_casado") and [@sarahdingwang](https://nitter.net/sarahdingwang "Sarah Wang") on the pod and he happened to do basic math™ on the logic of asics

today [@taalas\_inc](https://nitter.net/taalas_inc "Taalas Inc.") launched their HC1 asic that can inference 17k tok/s. Sure, it's a shitty 3.1 8B today which is a 1.5 year gap.

But read the details to the HC2 this winter, and do the math — this timeline will converge to 0 in the next 2 years.

Build accordingly.

For this measurement, we used our Triframe scaffold as usual (not Codex). We did a partial measurement with a Codex scaffold, and our results did not seem very different. This is in line with similar comparisons we’ve run in the past.

I looked into how Claude Code and Codex compare to the default scaffolds METR uses for time horizon measurements. It looks like they don't significantly outperform our default scaffolds on any models we've tried them on so far.

Orchestration design is now a first-class optimization target, independent of model scaling.

As LLMs from different providers converge toward comparable benchmark performance, picking the best model yields diminishing returns.

The real lever is orchestration topology, where you strategize how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized.

This paper introduces a framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs.

It formalizes a Performance Convergence Scaling Law showing when orchestration selection outweighs model selection, and includes a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps tasks to optimal patterns in O(\|V\| + \|E\|) time.

Results: 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models.

To be a real Human, one needs intelligence, courage, tenacity, curiosity, and a strong sense of justice. Remove any one of the five and you end up with the equivalent of a lemon. Remove the sense of justice and you end up with a monster.

Agree with the takeaway here, that our newest couple points on the graph are much weaker updates than previous points were. Of course, I do think they're substantial evidence that progress hasn't slowed down significantly.

I know I used that METR chart that’s been going around in an earlier post but just for what it’s worth, I myself don’t take it as much of an update. METR itself has been signaling their decreasing confidence in the benchmark for a while now bc of both saturation and limited long-duration tasks in the benchmark.

It’s certainly impressive and signals that nothing is decelerating, but I don’t see it as strong evidence in and of itself that we are in some radically faster progress regime.

Agentic extraction from SCOTUS opinions 🧑‍⚖️

Today SCOTUS struck down Trump’s tariffs in a 6-3 vote, and one of the most interesting points was Gorsuch’s concurrence, where he devotes a decent portion calling out every justice by name - especially around everyone in the dissent (Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito by extension).

I was curious about this, so I used LlamaExtract on the official court opinion to generate a schema that not only gives me an overall summary, but extracts particular disagreements Gorsuch has in each line item.
\\* We extract the specific disagreements with Kavanaugh and Thomas line by line
