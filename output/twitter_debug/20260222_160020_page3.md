I was thinking about memory and continual learning for LLMs

because it's so unsatisfying and inefficient having the LLMs literally write their own memories (as for my ARC-AGI-3 agent)

This is exactly what the traces showed in the side-by-side comparison

Same model, two harnesses, same prompt, completely different behavior

One searched for files before reading them even when the filename was in the prompt

2.7x token difference from harness decisions alone

Improving Deep Agents with harness engineering 👀

Our coding agent went from Top 30 to Top 5 on Terminal Bench 2.0. We only changed the harness.

The goal of a harness is to mold the inherently spiky intelligence of a model for tasks we care about.

Harness Engineering is about systems. You’re building tooling around the model to optimize goals like task performance, token efficiency, latency, etc. Design decisions include the system prompt, tool choice, and execution flow.

But how should you change the harness to improve your agent? (teaser: self-verification & tracing with LangSmith help a lot)

Chatted with a water resource economist at an event in California yesterday.

The state’s water “shortage” really is one of the most unforced errors in policymaking.

Key stats:

\- farmers use 80% of the developed water supply

\- residents use 20%

\- cities pay ~20x higher prices (!) for water than farmers (~$722/acre-foot vs ~$36/acre-foot)

\- some of the biggest agricultural districts in the state pay literally $0 for their water

\- meanwhile agriculture accounts for just ~2% of California’s economy

It’s crazy that politicians tell residents to take shorter showers or get rid of their lawns instead of just charging farmers the market price for their water usage.

the funny thing about robots is how there's still this upper-midwit idea of "humanoid body plan bad, spider good" used to dunk on Terminators. But the only reason we kept playing with hexapods was that our control policies sucked. 6+ legs are inherently stable.

I never do voice, I tried for a few days and it's too unnatural to me to talk to my computer

Especially considering there's people near me like gf or if I'm in a cafe etc

Voice coding is just too weird for me, and I think I can type faster than I talk

Daniel, other than being an outstanding mathematician, often gives reasonable takes against AI hype. Highly recommended read. Some quotes that stood out to me:

"I made a bet that AI tools would not be able to autonomously produce papers I judge to be at a level comparable to that of the best few papers published in 2025, at comparable cost to human experts, by 2030. I now expect to lose this bet"

"it's very likely that this technology is bigger than the computer"

California could solve its water crisis overnight if it stopped massively subsidizing water usage for low-value crops like alfalfa

Chatted with a water resource economist at an event in California yesterday.

The state’s water “shortage” really is one of the most unforced errors in policymaking.

Key stats:

\- farmers use 80% of the developed water supply

\- residents use 20%

\- cities pay ~20x higher prices (!) for water than farmers (~$722/acre-foot vs ~$36/acre-foot)

\- some of the biggest agricultural districts in the state pay literally $0 for their water

\- meanwhile agriculture accounts for just ~2% of California’s economy

It’s crazy that politicians tell residents to take shorter showers or get rid of their lawns instead of just charging farmers the market price for their water usage.

Of course that’s your contention. You’re a StartUpBro industrialist. You just finished reading the ‘Reindustrialize America’ thread and now you’re gonna pivot to vertically integrated, carbon-neutral steel.

You’re gonna be convinced of that until next quarter when you discover electricity costs and realize blast furnaces don’t run on vibes and intermittent wind credits. Then you’ll pivot to ‘green hydrogen direct reduced iron’ — that’ll last right up until you price power at industrial scale.

Well, as a matter of fact, we’ll secure domestic ore and strategically source critical inputs—”

—Strategically source? You mean import the iron ore we don’t mine at scale and politely ask China and Russia for the 75% of global manganese they control? That strategic?

“No, because we’re rebuilding American industrial capacity and—”

—Rebuilding? With what institutional knowledge? The guys who knew how to actually run integrated mills retired when we offshored production in the ‘90s.

“And anyway, tariffs will protect domestic producers—”

—controlled by the same cozy domestic monopoly you call ‘healthy competition.’ That your big plan? Carbon-neutral, monopoly-priced, VC-backed rebar?

Do you have any thoughts of your own on this, or are we just speedrunning Industrial Policy Fan Fiction?”

Some comments on Taalas HC1:

\- It’s real. Try it yourself. At ~16k tokens/sec, the output is instantaneous.

\- The current demo model is aggressively quantized (roughly 3–6 bits). The goal was to prove the system works end-to-end. Improving quantization quality, that's the easy part.

\- Their next iteration, a mid-size reasoning LLM, will be much more accurate.

\- The weights are frozen, but the chip supports LoRA adapters (high-rank), so you can still adapt it to your domain. In practice, you could also distill knowledge from newer/larger models into adapters to “refresh” what the chip can do without changing base weights.

\- Frontier open-weight models to land on the platform this year.

I've updated my estimates for Chinese export diversion and transshipment to the US to include late 2025 data. I also switched to a 2022-24 average as the baseline (vs just 2024). The story remains about the same. Chinese exporters found new markets for about 67% of what they lost in the US, and transshipment accounted for no more than 21% of trade diversion.

AI導入は「雇用不安小さい正社員制度が強みに」

日経ビジネスにて、Sakana AI CEO [@hardmaru](https://nitter.net/hardmaru "hardmaru") のインタビューが公開されました。企業へのAI実装が本格化する2026年における現状と課題、そして日本企業の組織文化がAI導入にとってポジティブに働く可能性について語りました。

[business.nikkei.com/atcl/gen…](https://business.nikkei.com/atcl/gen/19/00831/010800008/)

【記事のハイライト】

1\. 活用の鍵は「Human in the loop」 「生成AIの大規模言語モデル（LLM）は、人間が使う言葉とコンピューターを結ぶ優れたインターフェースになるでしょう。…一方で、利用者は出力結果が必ずしも完璧ではないことを認識する必要があります。だからこそ私たちは「人間の介在（Human in the loop）」が極めて重要だと考えています。」

2\. 日本独自の強み 「日本企業の特徴は終身雇用制度です。… 日本の終身雇用制度は、（解雇への不安が小さいため）米国と比較して、AIをより気軽に活用できる環境にあります。… 代替される心配がなければ、AIは社員にとって有益な存在となります。」

3\. 経営陣の役割 「AIと一口に言っても、単なるデータ分析から生成AIなど、種類は様々です。… 全社員にグーグルのGeminiやChatGPTのアカウントを付与すれば問題が解決する、という単純な話ではありません。日本企業の経営陣は、具体的な目標を明確に定義し、それに適したAIツールを選択する必要があります。」

4\. 過度な期待への警鐘 「生成AIは非常に新しい技術で、過剰な期待も少なくありません。ほとんどの分野で、導入すれば即座に成果が出るほどの準備が整っていないと考えています。… 現在の生成AIは、世間の期待に追いつこうとしている段階なのだと見ています。」

Automation kills executors.

It rewards orchestrators.If you’re an engineer: stop thinking in tasks, start thinking in systems.

Build pipelines, not features. Loops, not tickets. Products, not outputs.

Sustainable path = become the one who designs the machine not the one inside it.

Can an agent survive as a worker in a real economy?

Here is a super interesting economic benchmark for AI agents - ClawWork.

It’s like a real-world labor market for LLM-based agents that evaluates them in an economic survival loop.

ClawWork turns agents into AI coworkers and forces them to earn money through actual professional tasks.

Every token they use is paid:

\- Agents start with $10
\- They must complete real tasks from the GDPVal dataset – 220 professional tasks across 44 occupations
\- Income only comes from delivering quality work

For every LLM call, web search and code execution cost money, as well.

Other useful features:
• Supports head-to-head multi-model competition – GLM, Qwen, Kimi, GPT-based agents
• Integrates with Nanobot

Looking at the recursive LM (RLM) paper this morning.

It's actually quite simple and nice idea: give the LM a REPL.

The paper is marketed as solving long-context. But I think the key nugget is to give the LM a REPL.

The REPL is useful because:
\- Execute code in it -> let's you compute things
\- Has a function to query a sub LLM (basically sub-agents)
\- Can hold arbitrary state (like new variables etc).

Also I understood the paper much better by reading the system prompt than the actual paper 😅

Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws over the weekend. The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)

I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.

Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.

Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.

Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.

Improving Deep Agents with harness engineering 👀

Our coding agent went from Top 30 to Top 5 on Terminal Bench 2.0. We only changed the harness.

The goal of a harness is to mold the inherently spiky intelligence of a model for tasks we care about.

Harness Engineering is about systems. You’re building tooling around the model to optimize goals like task performance, token efficiency, latency, etc. Design decisions include the system prompt, tool choice, and execution flow.

But how should you change the harness to improve your agent? (teaser: self-verification & tracing with LangSmith help a lot)

The Shannon information is a wildly inadequate abstraction for talking about those things, because Shannon information doesn’t take computation into account

A solution to any math problem is predictable from the problem statement, so it contains zero Shannon information

Why is GLM-5 post-training distillation step done in this order?
Model A: SFT
Model B: Trained w/ Reasoning
Model C: Trained w/ Agentic
Model D: Trained w/ General
Model E: GLM-5
A -> B -> C -> D
E = Distill B, C into D
Why not distill previous model along with the next capability?
eg B - (distill B + Agentic) -> C

All these 'I moved from Claude Code to Codex' tweets and I literally don't know anyone who did. December was devs organically losing their minds over Claude Code. Sure, maybe Anthropic lit the match — but the fire spread on its own because the product was unreal. OpenAI is now trying to buy what Anthropic earned. It won't work.

I think one of the funniest things is how frontier labs spout how AI is writing their code, but the reality is that the products they ship are buggy, resource hungry messes. It's kind of the worst advertisement ever for both their products and their worldview.

New nuclear is crazy-and useless

$47.2 bil for 3.26 GW Hinkley Point C=$14.5/W vs $1/W for solar and wind

And HPC will take 22 years from planning to operation (2008-2030), vs 1-3 for PV/wind

Similar statistics for Vogtle

Vaporware SMRs are worse

James Liang is a Chinese billionaire who pays his employees 50K for every baby they make, who is launching a 1 Billion fund to pay PHD students to have children, here’s why…

James is the cofounder of [trip.com](http://trip.com/) worth $50B, he was also a prodigy academic who started college at 15, got a PHD at Stanford and then became a professor at China's top university PKU. He straddles not just the active and the contemplative life but elite circles across US and China.

Sitting at this unique intersection helped him articulate his most important idea: that demography is one of the most overlooked factors that impact innovation. The problem with an aging population is not just the financial strain on pensions but a cultural, technological stagnation that will suffocate any creative act. Gerontocracies (rule by the old) result in sterile, hierarchical, and unimaginative futures. If humanity is going to continue innovating, humanity needs to stay young. James believes offering money alone can significantly fix the problem and is putting his money where his mouth is.

In this interview, you will learn about the coming population collapse from one of the world’s foremost demography experts and what to do about it from one of the world’s most resourceful entrepreneurs.

Sent this message to a bunch of college friends with varying exposure to AI:

I've had a big shift in my perspective on AI over the past two years that I've mostly neglected to communicate to people, partially because it's been happening slowly in the background. I used to think that it was pretty plausible we'd hit a wall this decade with respect to some fundamental capability, but this has slowly been getting less likely to me as AI progress has continued, and now this seems very unlikely to me (<5%).

Previous technologies have never fully substituted for human labor—they've always been complementary. The fundamental reason for this is that previous technologies haven't been intelligent agents—they're merely tools that require intelligent agents to use them. I thought for many years that this could still turn out to be the case with the current paradigm of AI, but there's just been too much progress, and it's happening too rapidly, for this to seem plausible anymore.

What does this change in perspective mean concretely? I'm now quite confident that within the next 2-30 years, the economy and civilization will look totally, radically different from how it's operated for the past 2500 years. I still have a lot of uncertainty about what exactly this will look like—whether it'll be utopic, dystopic, maybe somewhere in between, or maybe we'll all be dead. But I feel very confident now that it's going to be totally insane and chaotic (like, many orders of magnitude more chaotic than anything the world has experienced in our lifetimes, like way way more significant than Covid, to pick a recent example).

I don't have a really concrete goal with sending this except that you're my best friends and it feels important for me to say my true beliefs to y'all. I guess I don't want you to be caught off guard. There are maybe two concrete takeaways/pieces of advice I feel comfortable giving: try to develop strong wellsprings of meaning and purpose from things outside of work (I think most of us are fine on this point), and start thinking about political actions you could take that feel true to you, that could plausibly help us muddle through the transition.

The core principle with hankweave has been to not build anything we didn't NEED. Six months in -

\- we didn't need parallel subagents
\- we use haiku more than opus
\- we still haven't needed skills or MCPs
\- everything's been possible with shell + fs tools

Interesting times.

Introducing: built-in git worktree support for Claude Code

Now, agents can run in parallel without interfering with one other. Each agent gets its own worktree and can work independently.

The Claude Code Desktop app has had built-in support for worktrees for a while, and now we're bringing it to CLI too.
