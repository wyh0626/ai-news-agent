is there a good way to start a new thread from an existing conversation in claude code or codex?

in claude code, I often use --resume --fork-session, but this feels like bad UX. I wish I could start multiple new threads inside my main "branch" (i.e., the main conversation) at different points and then merge back the results if needed

Well, it's time to revisit my prediction. I wrote a blogpost on the comparison: [ikot.blog/the-illusion-of-pa…](http://ikot.blog/the-illusion-of-parity)

In this post, we will retrospectively evaluate Kimi K2 Thinking on benchmarks released after the model's launch (16 in total).

This minimizes the chance of data contamination or overfitting.

Then, I'll explain why the results look the way they do and what that actually means for practical use.

TL;DR is that it does not look good for open source.

Prediction: in the next 2-3 months we'll see a suite of new benchmarks which will show that, in fact, Kimi's K2 is lagging behind frontier models.

(and some of these benchmarks will be multimodal... guess why K2/DS won't be there on the LB)

When people will start looking at the results outside the <release blogposts> that were picked by the authors?

A good illustration of my point could be the newest [@OfirPress](https://nitter.net/OfirPress "Ofir Press") 's bench. Luckily, they compared Qwen 3 Coder, which was advertised as a sonnet-4 level coder model, and you know what?

The further you go from the benchmarks in the announcement, the bigger the diff.

Piotr discovered something worrying: if you give an LLM a list of tools it's allowed to call, it might decide to also call a tool you didn't provide!

Be sure to check LLM tool call requests! (Lisette/Claudette check automatically)

Would you trust an LLM to handle access control? Major AI labs (Anthropic, xAI, Gemini) seem to do exactly that with tool calling. And it gets hairy. Let me explain 🧵 or read the blog post: [answer.ai/posts/2026-01-20-t…](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2026-01-20-toolcalling.html)

This seems like a case of schlep blindness. I bet an LLM could automate most of those interactions: set up a model to check the other model’s work, and make sure it checks thoroughly.

It’ll get it wrong sometimes, but it might be a net benefit. It’d be like a linter for Claude.

Claude Sonnet 4.6 (medium) scores 66.1% on WeirdML, matching Opus 4.6 (no thinking) and a big advance from Sonnet 4.5 at 47.7%.

I had to run it on medium reasoning level because the default (high) constantly hit the 64k max tokens limit. Even at medium it uses as many output tokens as gpt 5.2 (xhigh), and still hits the 64k-limit quite often.

Since Sonnet is almost as expensive as Opus, and is not much faster, I don't see many use-cases for this Sonnet version.

WeirdML v2 is now out! The update includes a bunch of new tasks (now 19 tasks total, up from 6), and results from all the latest models. We now also track api costs and other metadata which give more insight into the different models. The new results are shown in these two figures. The first one shows an overview of the overall results as well as the results on individual tasks, in addition to various metadata.

The second figure shows cost vs performance and shows a clear scaling with better results for higher costs. We also have a very varied pareto frontier with 11 models from 6 different companies having the best accuracy for a given cost for at least some of the cost range. Grok 3, Claude Opus 4 and GPT 4.5 are the ones that underperform for their costs, while Gemini pro and o3 pro have the best results at the highest costs. Qwen3 30B3A, grok 3 mini and deepseek R1 also each represent a good chunk of the pareto frontier.

So i asked Opus to benchmark multiple versions of a function for me.

The little \*\*\*\*er started the benchmarking of all variants \_in parallel on the same machine\_ and then reported the results... bruh

Yall who let it do research for you, better watch it like a prey!

And after saying that I'm absolutely right and great catch, it ran them sequentially.

Then, for the next round, in the very same convo, IT RAN THEM IN PARALLEL AGAIN.

Historians may conclude that Americans simply got bored with freedom, stability, and prosperity -- the fruits of ordered liberty -- and said, "Let's just burn the whole thing down." An act of national and historic vandalism.

With 5.2 Sam had earned the right to say "no, China is NOT underestimated". That model was a breakthrough towards not "autonomous agentic coding" or some myopic buzzword like that, but general superhuman cognition. 5.3 goes further.
Until China has 5.2 at least, they're no peers.

Free AI scientists for the US: Aristotle, a next-generation AI co-scientist, is launching its X1 family and Instant models, built in closed beta with researchers from Harvard, Stanford, and the NIH and is now completely free for verified U.S. scientists.

The platform tackles real research workflows, from literature synthesis and hypothesis generation to experimental validation, with models like X1 Verify (self-critiquing reasoning), X1 Search (knowledge-graph-powered discovery), and X1 Spark (ranked bold hypotheses).

A small PSA if you're using vLLM, you might find SGLang is faster on H100 and B200's. A little rabbit hole + some help from the vLLM folks and we figured out it's because vLLM would choose DeepGemm on some models, which isn't the best (Triton is)

Set VLLM\_USE\_DEEP\_GEMM=0!

My colleague and former physicist [@dlouapre](https://nitter.net/dlouapre "David Louapre") has written a truly wonderful exposition on the OpenAI result for scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory.

He's done a remarkable job at making a very complex topic accessible and I highly recommend reading it if you want to better understand what type of problem the authors were trying to solve and how GPT-5.2 helped.

During a fireside chat with [@alexrkonrad](https://nitter.net/alexrkonrad "Alex Konrad") from [@UpstartsMediaCo](https://nitter.net/UpstartsMediaCo "Upstarts Media") organized by [@dawncapital](https://nitter.net/dawncapital "Dawn Capital") on Wednesday, [@synthesiaIO](https://nitter.net/synthesiaIO "Synthesia 🎥") CEO [@vriparbelli](https://nitter.net/vriparbelli "Victor Riparbelli") was asked whether there were some advantages to building a company in the UK compared to decamping to Silicon Valley.

While the UK has its challenges, Victor said that moving to London was "a great life adventure" and that we should do more to sell the dream of living and working here. He added that the UK, and Europe in general, were "\[...\] great for kids. There are lots of green areas. There's free healthcare...we have culture."

Europe bashing has become a fashionable little sport in some tech circles. On podcasts and in viral threads on X, the punchline is always the same: "Europe is cooked." Serious builders leave to build the future abroad while everyone else is stuck living in the past. Except that’s not actually true.

Yes, some founders decide the US is the right arena for what they’re building. But plenty of people choose to stay in Europe and build anyway, and that’s the group we should be louder about celebrating, because they have 10x the ambition, the drive and the resilience. They’re proving you can have your cake and eat it.

Also, the traffic isn’t one-way. The data shows global talent visas from the US to Europe are rising year over year, which is a pretty awkward fact for all of those loud voices shouting “everyone is leaving.” And you can see it in real company stories.

Synthesia, for example, has hired senior execs from the US such as our CTO or CFO; both then moved to London. We have 90% of the Fortune 100 as customers, we build the best-in-class AI video products and services, and we have the most amazing people working in research, engineering, and product.

So maybe we should retire the lazy narratives and realize that Europe isn’t a waiting room for real tech. It’s a place where real companies are getting built by founders who could leave, but choose to stay.

This is not a prediction. It is an urgent WARNING warranted by the gravity of the situation. Potential consequences of only a LIMITED American strike on Iran that keeps the regime intact:

1) Iranians, believing that the “help on its way” has finally arrived, will mistakenly think they have backing for regime change and will pour out into the streets again, only to be MASSACRED AGAIN;

2) The Islamic Republic – which has no intention of making a deal that Trump finds acceptable, and knowing it won’t get another chance – will use the lull to retaliate with EVERYTHING it has, causing maximum American casualties;

3) Trump is humiliated, panics, and launches nuclear strikes on Iran – leading to massive civilian casualties and the death of all the most free-thinking and avant-garde Iranians in Tehran and other major cities.

This chain reaction may begin in less than 48 hours, and extend over the next few weeks, because we have a corrupt narcissist moron in the White House surrounded by equally corrupt sycophants and cronies for “advisors.”

The ONLY sound strategy here begins with an OVERWHELMING American strike aimed at regime change, one which decapitates the Islamic Republic within the first 48-72 hours. Anything less risks THIS disaster unfolding.

Taalas runs Llama 3 8B at 16k tokens per second per user. That's almost an order of magnitude increase even compared to SRAM-based systems like Cerebras.

Key idea: each chip is specialized to a given model. The chip is the model.

Sandboxes allow agents to run freely and securely, only requesting approval when they need to step outside it.

It looks like they use a LUT-like method for multiplication.
Make much more sense than directly doing multiplication in a transistor.
LUT-like methods are really good for low-bit parameters.

interesting.
if they can really store a 4bit value AND do fully digital multiplication in a SINGLE transistor as they claimed, then this path looks extremely promising.

and they only need to change 2 mask layers for different model weights.

Gemini Pro 3.1 (& other frontier models) are still terrible at Connect 4. Yet smashing ARC-AGI-2

That is weird, right? ARC was built to be resistant to overfitting. I guess the fully generalised world of ARC AGI puzzles is still a very narrow slice of spatial reasoning

Can someone explain to me how this model can be getting 77% on ARC-AGI-2 and still lose at Connect 4? The methodology says this is on the "semi-private" (not shared openly online) set which I assume is public to Google. Overfit? Lack of third party run evals? Connect 4 = AGI?

It's been interesting to observe that when the people want a champion and hero, they may elevate any pitiful creature, and eventually inflate it to kingly standing. Yoon, a nonentity, is now a martyr for Based Koreans supporting Charlie Kirk and Israel, standing up to the CCP.

Kirk, too, a mediocre gotcha guy in life, posthumously became a Korean/Yoonite hero. An ideology accretes by degrees…
it's all very pathetic and unseemly. Generally my great regret in life is that people can't be shamed into stopping being so pathetic. Confucius knew this pain.

We ran a randomized controlled trial to see if LLMs can help novices perform molecular biology in a wet-lab.

The results: LLMs may help in some aspects, but we found no significant increase at the core tasks end-to-end. That's lower than what experts predicted.

Our findings 🧵

The discourse about RMB exchange rate is bizarre. At the end of the day, the only valuable things that Europeans can make better than China are things they're not allowed to sell.
It'd be fair, I think, for PRC to take Plaza Accord 2.0 on the condition of lifting export controls.

Replying to [@karpathy](https://nitter.net/karpathy)

oh come on. You think your grandma wants to make her own app? Much less maintain it.

Everyone neglects the mental energy it takes to even \*think\* of what it is exactly you want.

The entire principle of apps relies on some faith that designers; and the collective feedback of their users, can come up with a workflow or design paradigm that is \*better\* than what you; an individual could come up with.

This is true for 99% of cases.

I’d be floored if even 1% of global users want bespoke applications for uber-specific needs. Not saying it’s useless; but it’s so far away from what average users want.

Claude Code has regressed an absurd amount in the last few days.

Timestamps no longer update unless you un-focus/re-focus the tab. "thinking" doesn't show at all. I had a query run for 6 minutes with 0 output. This is genuinely unpleasant to use.
