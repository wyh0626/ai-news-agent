Researchers built Dr. CaBot, a medical AI agent trained on thousands of clinical case studies to diagnose illness, explain its reasoning, and prescribe next steps.

In tests, it provided the correct diagnosis for conditions far more often than human internists and produced explanations doctors often preferred.

What problem is Trump's new global 10% tariff meant to solve?

If it's about leverage, ask: How much leverage do you get from a tariff that disappears in 150 days?

If it's onshoring: Who builds new factories based on tariff that disappear before the factory is built?

It's a tax. That's all it is.

Looking at the recursive LM (RLM) paper this morning.

It's actually quite simple and nice idea: give the LM a REPL.

The paper is marketed as solving long-context. But I think the key nugget is to give the LM a REPL.

The REPL is useful because:
\- Execute code in it -> let's you compute things
\- Has a function to query a sub LLM (basically sub-agents)
\- Can hold arbitrary state (like new variables etc).

Also I understood the paper much better by reading the system prompt than the actual paper 😅

AI makes life so much easier

Everyone is automating their processes, building applications, and other important things.

What about ordinary, mundane matters?

My dishwasher broke down, and I decided to see if AI could help me figure out what was wrong and fix it.

I am not a repair expert. I have the usual skills of a man, such as hanging a TV or fixing a childs toy.

I entered my query, entered my device model, and received step-by-step instructions.

Following his advice, I took it apart, examined it, and identified the causes. I went to the nearest store, bought the necessary replacement parts, and spent about $11.

I carefully replaced everything, started it up, and everything works.

Thank you [@yupp\_ai](https://nitter.net/yupp_ai "Yupp") for your help

By the way, GPT was significantly better in this regard.

Patrick Collison on what changes when biology becomes programmable:

"We, humanity, have never cured a complex disease."

"Most cardiovascular disease, most cancers, most autoimmune disease, most neurodegenerative disease... For none of them can we really say that we've cured it, that we understand the causal pathways in meaningful detail."

"Then over the last 10 ish years... we’ve gotten three new classes of technology in biology."

"If you put those together, you now have the ability… to read, think, and to write. And this starts to really feel like a new kind of Turing loop."

Just so we’re clear… Howard Lutnik is the \*architect\* of Trump’s tariff plan. He’s the one who pushed Trump on these.

And at the EXACT SAME TIME that he was doing this, Lutnik’s sons \*\*who he appointed to take over his bank\*\* were betting the tariffs would be struck down and buying up refund rights at $0.25 on the dollar.

And now the government owes companies refunds… and depending on how many refund slips they are holding, the Lutnik’s bank could make BILLIONS of dollars.

There’s nothing else I can say about this that won’t catch me a permaban

The era of "coding" as a niche skill is officially dead. When you see a cardiologist and a musician winning a hackathon, it means the abstraction layer has finally moved to the reasoning level.

Most people still think it's just a better chatbot, but it's really about Agentic RL maturing in production. We are seeing these agents exploring state spaces that even senior devs find tedious. This is exactly why we're optimizing the hell out of RL rollout engines at the infra level.

What's the upper bound on SWE-Bench-Verified?

I yoinked a bunch of EpochAI data and analyzed it.
However, I only got to download 21 files, now it seems im permanently blocked from downloading anything lol

44/500 = 8.8% of SWE-Bench-Verified questions are either unsolvable or still too hard for even the best models like Opus 4.6 Thinking

With that we can say that the upper-bound is at least 91.2% on SWE-Bench Verified.

The hardest subset of question seems to be pylint-dev and astropy.

There were 3 questions that were only solvable by Gemini 3.0 Pro, 2 questions only solvable by GPT-5.1 and 2 questions only solvable by Kimi-K2.5

You will see the GPT-5.1 rows and columns are very bright, meaning there is almost no overlap in failures between GPT-5.1 and the other models, which is why they reran it.
Its pass rate is still pretty high at 65.9% but I guess it failed a lot of the easy tasks which is why the rows and columns are bright. The two tasks that were only solvable by GPT-5.1 might be buggy.

Prediction: I believe that Step 3.6-Flash (coming ≈ 10th April?) will be the best <200B model by then, and the best model that fits in a 128 Gb GPU. Crazy fast, with reasoning effort control, robust tool calling, concise, \*and\* multimodal. Maybe then they'll get really noticed.

I’ve read that Nikolai Komyagin has died — one of the most talented and honest Russian musicians — at 39.

His band, Shortparis, usually filed under the loose label of “Russian rock,” probably played what could best be described as “Russian chthonic.” On stage, it felt like the closest possible equivalent to the photographs of Dmitry Markov.

He grew up in Novokuznetsk. The post-industrial Novokuznetsk of vocational school kids and pensioners was present in his work — on stage, in the sound, and off stage, in the audience. On stage, it was perhaps the most serious contemporary embodiment of the Soviet synthesis of art and industry, avant-garde and VKhUTEMAS, worker and artist — but without state patronage, and with the bitter knowledge of how that synthesis ends.

In the audience — because he did not merely bring industrial lads and retired military men onto the stage and into his videos, he quite literally played for them. Not only at Moscow’s Gogol Center or the Khlebozavod cultural space, but right there, for his own people, for the heroes of his songs.

In recent years he hardly performed, though he continued to live there — concerts were cancelled and then banned. At one point he was not even allowed to step onstage to greet the audience of a festival he had curated in one of the small towns of the Arkhangelsk region.

Well, in Russia an outstanding musician being prevented from performing — that’s hardly news. And yet Shortparis — you would wait for Western tours — were in fact very popular in China. They played festivals there, toured the country, gave full concert runs. It is worth noting to ourselves: a musician sharp in form and content, banned in Russia, could perform in dictatorial China. The Chinese audience must have recognized something of its own in that mournful proletkult — beyond appreciating the voice and the gift.

Our acquaintance began at a distance and became personal in the first winter of the war, at Julian Christmas. At a tiny micro-conference — literally just a handful of people — Kolya gave a talk, and it was strikingly intelligent, of a very high scholarly and lecturing standard. Later he briefly passed through Florence: we walked past buildings, talked, entertained a Spitz.

A classical composer can hope that his music will be performed after his death. Contemporary music, unfortunately, almost always departs together with the musician and his singular manner. Let us keep listening to and watching what remains. [piped.video/watch?v=12CsEuxN…](https://piped.video/watch?v=12CsEuxN5vQ)

What many still don't understand: it's impossible to slow down AI development.

The US is in direct competition with China. A slowdown would mean the US would lose its leadership and allow China to achieve superintelligence.

However, AI is of strategic interest, especially for the military (autonomous drones, robots, and also cyberattacks), so leadership is directly constrained by geopolitical power ambitions.

This looks realistic. Maybe an undercount by 10% or so, owing to the time lag. 4 years, 48 months, 4 thousand death a month on average, accelerating lately to perhaps 8k. If it stabilizes at ≤10K/month, Russia can keep this up for 4-6 years more (ignoring other constraints).

The BBC, Mediazona & Meduza have verified the death of 186,102 Russian soldiers from 24-FEB-2022 to 20-FEB-2026.

This does not include 21.5K to 23.0K soldiers KIA from occupied Luhansk & Donetsk. The data is compiled from obituaries, open data from the Russian government & announcements from RMOD.

Ukrainian forces destroy a valuable Russian 9A54 Tornado-S 300mm heavy multiple rocket launcher after it was detected while firing a salvo.

The strike with an FP-2 attack drone, which was aimed at the Tornado-S' launch tubes, caused an ammunition detonation and obliteration of the vehicle.

Tornado-S is sometimes described as a Russian analogue of HIMARS. It is capable of firing guided munitions, mainly 9M542, to a range of up to 120 kilometers.

Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws over the weekend. The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)

I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.

Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.

Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.

Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.

OpenAI has raised its revenue forecast by 27%, projecting $30B in 2026 and $62B in 2027 after tripling revenue to $13.1B last year, fueled by explosive growth from ChatGPT subscriptions, enterprise AI, and new ads and hardware bets.

Weekly active users hit 910M (still shy of its 1B goal), while enterprise revenue is set to more than triple to $8B this year as OpenAI pushes deeper into corporate AI tools.

Cool finding: temporally autoregressive video diffusion models use lower layers for noise-level-independent causal processing, and upper layers for intra-frame denoising.

Explicitly separating them brings practical and speed benefits! Reminds me of the AlphaFold 3 architecture🤔

Do causal video diffusers really need dense causal attention at every layer, every denoising step?

We looked inside and found: no. Causality is separable from denoising.

Here are two surprising observations that hold across architectures, training objectives, and scales.

The more I simmer on this the more I am a fan of explicitly decoupling encoding the context this way.

I wonder how asymmetric scaling of the encoder/decoder would perform, I imagine a relatively small decoder with a chonky encoder would handle it fairly well.

The encoder would become the more generative component capturing the temporal relationships and next frame state, then the decoder basically just needs to visualize the state correctly, similar to ( [arxiv.org/abs/2510.22852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22852))

The cost of code is coming down, so we will consume more of it.

The productivity of coders is going up, so they will become more valuable.

Coding now includes training and driving models.

Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries.

As the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research.

It was a very bright day for the American Republic. Handpicking the Supreme Court… doesn't actually accomplish much. They aren't political pawns, they're doing their specific job in accordance with the law.

Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to "regulate imports", didn't actually mean it. This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.

President Trump has a wide range of other tariff powers and he will use them to defend American workers and advance this administration’s trade priorities.

Community note

The 6-3 ruling upholds the Constitution, which reserves the power to tax exclusively for Congress. The Court determined tariffs are taxes, and the 1977 IEEPA's power to "regulate" imports does not explicitly delegate this taxing authority to the President.

Open Source models are closing the gap on coding
The gap has increased in other areas like world knowledge, problem-solving, anything that doesn't involve coding etc

in awe of the density of Wenfeng's interviews. It's approaching the Analects. Simple things, infinitely worth repeating. «Xiaoren suck. Don't be a Xiaoren. Stand up on two legs, look up to the sky.» Yet they refuse to learn. Still muh ApPliCaTioNs.
He should talk again.

On the year of the horse, China is celebrating wild horses that they helped bring back from the brink of extinction.
2036 will be Year of the Fire Dragon. Can we ask China to progress enough by that point to… you know…?

Dawn has broken on the Year of the Horse — a zodiac animal whose history in China, and whose present-day image, largely revolves around domesticated horses. They are the elegant steeds in equestrian events and those galloping over the grasslands.

But China is also home to the last truly wild horses on earth — Przewalski’s horses. For millennia, these stocky, dun-colored animals roamed freely across the vast steppes and deserts of Central Asia, including what is now northwestern China. But by the mid-20th century, hunting and habitat loss had driven them to the edge. In 1969, following the last confirmed sighting by Mongolian biologists, the species was declared extinct in the wild.

Today, however, the silence of the steppe has been broken. After four decades of relentless conservation, China has successfully rebuilt its wild population to over 900 individuals — approximately one-third of the global total — establishing one of the world’s most successful large mammal reintroduction programs.

Rewind to the 1970s, and the wilderness of China and Mongolia held no trace of the Przewalski’s horse. The species’ survival hung by a thread, preserved only in European zoos. These captive herds were the descendants of just 12 wild individuals captured by European explorers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This tiny founder population created a severe genetic bottleneck, leaving the species vulnerable to inbreeding and low genetic diversity.

The turning point came in 1978, when the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse, based in the Netherlands, issued a call to reintroduce the species to its native habitat. China responded in 1985 with the “Wild Horse Homecoming” project, establishing the Xinjiang Wild Horse Breeding and Research Center on the edge of the Junggar Basin, a large steppe that was once part of the horse’s natural habitat. In December 1986, the first batch of 11 Przewalski’s horses arrived from the United Kingdom and Germany. Stepping out of trucks into the snowy landscape, they had returned home, but their journey was just beginning.
