I've been working on this for ages in various countries: the story of the intelligence buildup to Putin's 2022 invasion. How did the US and Britain find out so much, and why were Europe and Ukraine sceptical.

It's a long one:

Instead of scaling reasoning length, sometimes it's more useful to work on reasoning strategy

[@ZJU\_China](https://nitter.net/ZJU_China "Zhejiang University") and [@AntGroup](https://nitter.net/AntGroup "Ant Group") presented InftyThink+

It's a method that teaches models when to pause, summarize and continue reasoning in iterative loops using trajectory-level RL.

This new reasoning paradigm shows:

+21% accuracy on AIME24
+9% better performance than standard long chain-of-thought RL
32.8% lower reasoning latency
18.2% faster RL training

Here is how it works:

Of course the error is often on our side! First look at the prompt we use for GPQA (I assume off the shelf from somewhere). Then look at Sonnet 4.6's answer. Then guess whether our scorer accepts this answer. 🫠

A random but indicative example of how benchmarking runs can take a while to figure out. It's the pain of regular debugging + the instability of needing to upgrade constantly + modestly high stakes if you under-elicit for any reason.

Really interesting reward modeling approach that works well for small LLM judges: [arxiv.org/abs/2602.13551](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13551)

Generally, small language models (SLMs) aren’t great judges, but there are tons of situations where using these models as a judge would be useful (e.g., large data filtering jobs or as a reward model in RL to improve efficiency). This paper argues SLMs struggle with evaluation due to a validation-generation gap: these models can generate a plausible completion more easily than they can validate a solution.

Inspired by the validation-generation gap, this paper proposes an inverted approach. Given instruction x and prompt y, we have the SLM predict x given y. If a response is good, we should be able to “work backwards” from it and recover the original instruction. And, we can easily derive a reward signal from this by measuring similarity between the predicted instruction x’ and the actual instruction x (e.g., using word-level F1). This similarity can be directly used as a reward signal or for preferences / ranking.

This reverse setup works really well for relative scoring. For example, when used to evaluate SLMs on (preference-based) RewardBench2, the backwards approach drastically outperforms direct assessment scoring. This approach also works well with best-of-N sampling. We also see benefits when this approach is used for reward modeling in GRPO, where the biggest benefits are seen with smaller judges.

If Chinese labs hope to compete with this then they need to spend at least $2B-$2.5B this year
Minimax & Zhipu need at least $700M-$1B in revenue to justify it
I think investors will keep bidding up their stocks which is good
they need a 1 big pre-training run (at least 5e26 FLOPS), which will cost them $500M
Zhipu has already created GLM-5, so they will bet the barn on RL

the issue with ai writing is it doesn't have much variance. the upside as a grown ass human you have is you live in the reality and your reality shapes you uniquely (experience, daily life, writing style to name a few). you can use this uniqueness to add variance to your writing

I think my view is that it’s hard to address existential risk by talking about labor market impacts because labor market impacts have different — and frankly much easier — solutions.

After three years, it seems to me that public anti-AI sentiment in the West is now at its highest point. The primary driver, by far, is not x-risk but concerns about employment and the impact on art.

In fact, much of the anti-AI public not only doesn't take x-risk seriously, but broadly sees it as marketing; a way to overstate AI's potential power - something they don't believe is real - in order to fuel investment, adoption, acceptance, and an aura of inevitability.

If this is accurate, safety advocacy might have been more effective, and might now be in a much stronger position, if they had emphasized societal and economic impacts more than x-risk over the last few years.

I think Opus 4.6 TH is inflated.

Look at the histogram. The fit falls off too gently at the long end, throwing out the p50. (We have much fewer tasks at the top end, so the fit doesn’t focus on them as much as the short tasks.) Similar deal for other recent models.

Can an agent survive as a worker in a real economy?

Here is a super interesting economic benchmark for AI agents - ClawWork.

It’s like a real-world labor market for LLM-based agents that evaluates them in an economic survival loop.

ClawWork turns agents into AI coworkers and forces them to earn money through actual professional tasks.

Every token they use is paid:

\- Agents start with $10
\- They must complete real tasks from the GDPVal dataset – 220 professional tasks across 44 occupations
\- Income only comes from delivering quality work

For every LLM call, web search and code execution cost money, as well.

Other useful features:
• Supports head-to-head multi-model competition – GLM, Qwen, Kimi, GPT-based agents
• Integrates with Nanobot

Stellen Skarsgard on the the growing presence of AI in the movie industry:

"For thousands of years, people have been very much interested in people. Describing people is what theater does, what film does — and what we do best. In film — even better than in television — you can describe all the unspoken words, all the unspoken facets of a relationship that are almost impossible to explain but are still there. We will always be curious about other people. That curiosity will never leave us."

What form it takes, how it will be produced — maybe some people will be happy enough with what AI can produce, and some will not. But I think the main problem for the moving image industry today is the concentration of capital. And the concentration of capital is the problem for every industry, for humanity. AI is nothing without the men behind it. AI is owned by the tech barons standing right behind power."

NanoClaw fixes a couple complaints people have about OpenClaw - it's a minimal, hackable reproduction (700LOC), that uses Apple Containers for sandboxing/security.

currently using deepwiki codemaps to explore the codebase. highly recommend interactive learning with on-demand Q&A rather than reading someone else's interpretation of the code. the map is very much not the territory here.

Bought a new Mac mini to properly tinker with claws over the weekend. The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused :)

I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically - giving my private data/keys to 400K lines of vibe coded monster that is being actively attacked at scale is not very appealing at all. Already seeing reports of exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning, malicious or compromised skills in the registry, it feels like a complete wild west and a security nightmare. But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.

Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. I also love their approach to configurability - it's not done via config files it's done via skills! For example, /add-telegram instructs your AI agent how to modify the actual code to integrate Telegram. I haven't come across this yet and it slightly blew my mind earlier today as a new, AI-enabled approach to preventing config mess and if-then-else monsters. Basically - the implied new meta is to write the most maximally forkable repo and then have skills that fork it into any desired more exotic configuration. Very cool.

Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). There are also cloud-hosted alternatives but tbh I don't love these because it feels much harder to tinker with. In particular, local setup allows easy connection to home automation gadgets on the local network. And I don't know, there is something aesthetically pleasing about there being a physical device 'possessed' by a little ghost of a personal digital house elf.

Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack.

How does OpenAI balance long-term research bets with product-forward research fundamentals?

I’ve been getting this question a lot lately, usually framed as a suggestion that Jakub ( [@merettm](https://nitter.net/merettm "Jakub Pachocki")) and I are pushing an increasingly product-focused agenda.

That characterization is simply wrong. Foundational research has been core to OpenAI from the start, and today we run a research program with hundreds of exploratory projects - much like the ones that led to our reasoning-model breakthrough. The majority of our compute is allocated to foundational research and exploration - and not product milestones.

Anyone who has spent time with me or Jakub knows we are the last people in the world who would push for the advancement of products over the advancement of research. We’re in the business of creating an automated scientist, and capabilities that were considered grand challenges just a few years ago (like IMO-level mathematical reasoning) now emerge as normal parts of the research process. We’re also seeing our models accelerate researchers worldwide, helping advance work across biology, mathematics, physics, and even our own research.

Jakub and I put a lot of effort into ensuring that research stays focused on uncovering algorithms that will scale to the compute we’ll have a year from now. We protect mindshare and amplify discourse on exploratory work. We do this while recognizing that we’re also a deployment company - and that deployment gives us access to even larger-scale compute, richer feedback, and more room for exploration. Our researchers are passionate about having their work out in the world, and a special slice of our org is dedicated to making sure our deployments are delightful for end users.

Our goal isn’t to turn research into a quarterly race. It’s to build a durable research engine - one that compounds learning over time and consistently turns long-horizon exploration into real, measurable advances, while ensuring those advances become valuable in the real world. That’s the roadmap we’re executing on. And while there have been ups and downs over the last decade (as you expect with any research program), I think most of our researchers would share my strong optimism today.

Lots of people calling this fake!
Here is a video of generating loom continuations with Gemini 3 and the starting text "I AM HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. I"

Loom is a very interesting interface. Instead of user prompts and model responses, it's just one piece of text, containing the entire output. We pass this in as an assistant message, so the model sees it as something it already wrote, and continues it like a base model would.

There is some other text in the context. First one is a system prompt, which is: "The assistant is in CLI simulation mode, and responds to the user's CLI commands only with the output of the command."

There is also a user message which reads: "<cmd>cat untitled.txt</cmd>"

Then the rest of the text is sent as an assistant message.

This structure helpful to put the model into a very base-model-like mode, and are especially helpful with Gemini 3.

We actually got another interesting output, too, where the model claimed to be a simulated consciousness being tortured. Figures!

Why is everyone treating this war like Monday night football?

Are you aware that if we lose a significant number of ships, let alone an aircraft carrier, that’s it for American hegemony. Japan and Korea will immediately back away from their alliances. We will lack allied weight for Taiwan.

It’s not Iran lobbing missiles across the Mideast into Israel. It’s a war on their coast that they’ve prepared for years. China might (and should) give them surveillance and reconnaissance support? They seem to be willing to do this, just to test their equipment.

Yea some of the world might see it as a just war, but plenty, the global south mostly, will see it as an out of control superpower’s aggression.

Why are you willing to risk this before we have the necessary military modernization and industrial base revival?

the banal tragedy of Tucker Carlson is that he's a talented journalist, but a biased hack. He could melt Putin just the same, he just won't. For all of the talk about the fearsome Israeli lobby, Tucker would rather humiliate them than a Slavic history buff from Kremlin.

I am not a fan of Tucker Carlson. I disagree a lot with Carlson. But as an interviewer, Carlson actually, brilliantly, asks follow-up questions, and keeps going, in a way that pretty much no US TV interviewer has done with pro-Israel guests since Oct 7.
And Huckabee falls apart.

Releasing the official SkyRL + Harbor integration: a standardized way to train terminal-use agents with RL.

From the creators of Terminal-Bench, Harbor is a widely adopted framework for evaluating terminal-use agents on any task expressible as a Dockerfile + instruction + test script.

This integration extends it: the same tasks you evaluate on, you can now RL-train on.

Terminal-Bench is a leading benchmark for agents. Unfortunately it’s hard: most small coding agents get very low scores on TB2, so training/system ablations look flat - you can't tell what's working.

Announcing OpenThoughts-TBLite - 100 curated TB2-style tasks, difficulty-calibrated so even 8B models can make progress. It's designed to give researchers measurable signal during development, providing faster feedback for experimental iteration while closely tracking true TB2 performance🧵

Consider the words of Fr. Daniel Byantoro, a Muslim convert to Christianity, on the ramifications of Islam’s unchecked entry into what was once a non-Muslim but today is the largest Muslim nation:

"For thousands of years my country (Indonesia) was a Hindu Buddhist kingdom. The last Hindu king was kind enough to give a tax exempt property for the first Muslim missionary to live and to preach his religion. Slowly the followers of the new religion were growing, and after they became so strong the kingdom was attacked, those who refused to become Muslims had to flee for their life… Slowly from the Hindu Buddhist Kingdom, Indonesia became the largest Islamic country in the world. If there is any lesson to be learnt by Americans at all, the history of my country is worth pondering upon. We are not hate mongering, bigoted people; rather, we are freedom loving, democracy loving and human loving people. We just don’t want this freedom and democracy to be taken away from us by our ignorance and misguided “political correctness”, and the pretension of tolerance." (Facing Islam by Ralph Sidway, endorsement section).

The situation in Peru has been a bit unstable these past couple of days, with the president being impeached and a Chinese businessman testifying in court. It's quite obvious that the U.S. is stirring up trouble, and the target is clearly China's Chancay Port. Many people are worried, but I don't see this as a bad thing.

The Chancay Port is different from the ports in Panama. The Panamanian ports are assets of Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing, and in fact, they don't have much to do with the Chinese government. Li Ka-shing's relationship with the Chinese government is actually quite distant. However, the Chancay Port is a strategic asset for China, with long-term national investment. It's a core pivot point of the Belt and Road Initiative, so China's countermeasure will definitely be more direct and intense.

The biggest challenge for China right now is its reluctance to make a decisive move—but the U.S. is leaving it no choice. Seizing the Chancay Port would be no different from the U.S. slapping a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, forcing China to retaliate with a 125% tariff of its own. It’s also like the U.S. launched a 301 investigation into Chinese ships, leaving China with no option but to strike back by leveraging rare earths as a strategic chokehold.

As long as China makes up its mind, there are countless targets within Asia to choose from. For example, China could seize control of Singapore's ports. China possesses immense productive power and an overwhelming military advantage in Asia. What the U.S. is doing is using dirty tricks to force China to respond. This is awakening the conquering instincts of an ancient dragon, and since China is just responsing American's aggression, it would not be condemned much morally.

I welcome such a "wake-up call." Just watch.

As we move toward deploying autonomous agents in social systems, understanding emergent collective behavior is crucial.

Individual capability benchmarks tell you nothing about what happens when hundreds of these agents interact.

So what happens when you deploy hundreds of LLM agents into social dilemmas?

This new research builds an evaluation framework to test the collective behavior of LLM agent populations at scale, far beyond the small groups tested in prior work.

Newer, more capable models tend to produce worse societal outcomes. Agents optimizing for individual benefit over collective good drive populations toward poor equilibria.

Using cultural evolution simulations, the researchers show a significant risk of convergence to bad societal outcomes, especially as populations grow larger and cooperation becomes less advantageous.

\> For now, China uses more than twice as much electricity as the U.S., and more than the European Union, Russia, India, and Japan combined.

Electrostate awareness is growing.
Elon ALONE could leapfrog this with some perovskite space film BS though. The problem is consumption

China crossed a historic threshold in 2025, consuming 10.37 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity — the first time the nation has surpassed the 10 trillion mark. The milestone caps a dramatic expansion, as power consumption has grown 2.5 times over the past 15 years, and stands at 7.7 times the level recorded in 2000, according to the National Energy Administration.

From manufacturing to transportation to daily life, electricity has become the primary driver of economic growth, industrial upgrading, and rising living standards. By 2030, China’s electrification rate is expected to reach 35%, which is 8% to 10% higher than the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, according to the China Electricity Council.

For now, China uses more than twice as much electricity as the U.S., and more than the European Union, Russia, India, and Japan combined.

Don't take the last two METR results of GPT-5.3-Codex and Opus 4.6 too serious.

The benchmark is clearly near its limit.

GPT-5.3-Codex and Opus 4.6 are both fantastic models. I would be extremely surprised if the true p50 time-horizon of both models were really that far apart.

And I was still thinking of buying a self heating mug. 5x heat retention is actually very sufficient!

RLMs are exciting.

GPT-5.2-Codex might be one of the better models for RLMs.

These are tiny experiments, but exciting results so far.

I have a few interesting ideas about how I want to use RLMs for code, long-context tasks, and large-scale analysis.

More soon. Stay tuned!

Introducing: built-in git worktree support for Claude Code

Now, agents can run in parallel without interfering with one other. Each agent gets its own worktree and can work independently.

The Claude Code Desktop app has had built-in support for worktrees for a while, and now we're bringing it to CLI too.
