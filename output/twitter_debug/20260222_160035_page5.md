Terminal-Bench is a leading benchmark for agents. Unfortunately it’s hard: most small coding agents get very low scores on TB2, so training/system ablations look flat - you can't tell what's working.

Announcing OpenThoughts-TBLite - 100 curated TB2-style tasks, difficulty-calibrated so even 8B models can make progress. It's designed to give researchers measurable signal during development, providing faster feedback for experimental iteration while closely tracking true TB2 performance🧵

This 𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗨𝗗𝗘.𝗺𝗱 file will make you 10x engineer 👇

It combines all the best practices shared by Claude Code creator:

Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code at Anthropic) shared on X internal best practices and workflows he and his team actually use with Claude Code daily. Someone turned those threads into a structured 𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗨𝗗𝗘.𝗺𝗱 you can drop into any project.

It includes:
• Workflow orchestration
• Subagent strategy
• Self-improvement loop
• Verification before done
• Autonomous bug fixing
• Core principles

This is a compounding system. Every correction you make gets captured as a rule. Over time, Claude's mistake rate drops because it learns from your feedback.

If you build with AI daily, this will save you a lot of time.

The BBC just released a new adaptation of Lord of the Flies, the classic novel by William Golding. It's beautifully made, but it's still telling the wrong story.

A few years ago, I went looking for the \*real\* Lord of the Flies. I wanted to know: has it ever actually happened? Have kids ever been shipwrecked on a deserted island?

It took me a year of research, but I found it. In 1965, six boys from a boarding school in Tonga stole a boat, got caught in a storm, and drifted for eight days without food or water. They washed up on 'Ata, a remote, uninhabited island in the Pacific. They stayed there for 15 months, and what happened on that island was the exact opposite of William Golding's novel.

These boys set up a small commune. They built a food garden, stored rainwater in hollowed-out tree trunks, created a gym with improvised weights, and built a badminton court. One of them, Stephen (who would later become an engineer) managed to start a fire using two sticks. They kept it burning the entire time.

Of course they fought too. But then they argued, they had a rule: go to opposite ends of the island, cool down, then come back and apologize. As one of them told me: ‘That's how we stayed friends.’

Back home, everyone assumed that the boys – Luke, Stephen, Sione, David, Kolo and Mano — were dead. When they were finally discovered by an Australian captain named Peter Warner, he radioed their names to Tonga. After twenty minutes, a tearful response came back: ‘You found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it's them, this is a miracle!’

Peter commissioned a new ship, hired all six boys as his crew, and named the boat the Ata, after the island where he found them. They remained friends for the rest of their lives – Peter and Mano even became soulmates. I tracked them down, and it became one of the central chapters of my book Humankind.

Here's what struck me most: William Golding (the author of Lord of the Flies) was a troubled man, an alcoholic who once said ‘I have always understood the Nazis, because I am of that sort by nature.’ I think he was projecting his own darkness onto children. And we turned it into a lesson about human nature that we teach to millions of kids around the world.

I think the real lesson is the opposite. When real children found themselves alone on a real island, they didn't descend into savagery. They cooperated, they took care of each other, they survived.

I'm not saying that the Tongan castaways were representative of all kids everywhere. But I am saying that every kid who has to read or watch the fictional Lord of the Flies also deserves to know what actually happened when it played out in real life.

Stories are never just stories. We become the stories that we tell ourselves.

i was just looking into it for a project and accidentally ended up making an actual native codex iphone app

i can spawn and talk to codexes anywhere on my network
and one of the best parts... I built and linked codex into the actual iphone app and it now runs locally on the actual iphone

Why is Qatar so worried about a war in Iran ?

Many people have rightly commented about the violent oppression of Iranian citizens by the Islamic Republic, about the regime’s funding of proxy wars and terrorism across the region, about its nuclear weapons program and continual attacks on U.S. military personnel.

But there is another major economic issue that is not so widely discussed. The South Pars (Iran) / North Dome (Qatar) is the world's largest natural gas field.

Qatar has aggressively developed its side of the field for LNG exports (world-leading capacity with ongoing expansions). Meanwhile, Iran lags significantly behind due to sanctions, limited technology/access to foreign investment and focus on domestic use.

There is currently no formal joint management or revenue-sharing agreement for the field, with concerns about Qatar draining reserves via faster extraction/pressure boosts.

A regime change in Iran could enable faster development, access to Western tech/investment and potential competition in LNG markets, pressuring Qatar's dominance or leading to new cooperation/deals.

The potential impact on Qatar’s future national revenue is not to be underestimated.

I realized this is a bit of a vague post if you're unfamiliar with Electron or why it is at odds with the future we're (hoping!) agentic coding enables.

Electron is a coding framework for building desktop applications using web tech, specifically HTML, CSS, and JS. What's great about Electron is it allows you to build one desktop app that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux. Plus you get to use lots of your website code to get started! It's great for teams big and small. So many apps you probably use are Electron: Slack, Discord, etc.

There are many downsides though. Electron apps are bloaty; each is running its own Chromium engine. They are often laggy or unresponsive. They don't integrate optimally with OS features.

(These last two \*can\* be addressed by smart development and OS-specific code, but they so rarely are. imo, the benefits of Electron (one codebase, many platforms, its just web!) don't incentivize optimizations outside of HTML/JS/CSS land.)

But these downsides are/were dramatically outweighed by the ability to build and maintain one app, and ship it everywhere.

But now we have coding agents. And one thing coding agents are proving to be pretty good at is cross-platform, cross-language implementations given a well-defined spec and test suite. See: [dbreunig.com/2026/02/06/the-…](https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/06/the-rise-of-spec-driven-development.html)

This attribute of agents should render Electron's benefits obsolete! Rather than write one web app and ship it to each platform, we should write \_one spec and test suite\_ and use coding agents to ship \_native\_ code to each platform. If this promise of agents is actually delivered, users would get snappy, performant, lightweight apps. While dev teams could stay small, focused, and support a broad market.

But this isn't the case (yet) for a whole host of reasons.

For one thing, coding agents are \_really\_ good at the first 90% of dev. But that last bit – nailing down all the edge cases and continuing support once it meets the real world – remains hard, tedious, and requires much hand-holding.

Further, with 3 different apps produced (Mac, Windows, and Linux) the surface area for bugs and support increases 3-fold. Sure, there are local quirks with Electron apps, but most of it is mitigated by the common wrapper. Not so with native!

A good test suite and spec \_could\_ enable the Claude team to ship a Claude desktop app native to each platform. But the resulting overhead of that last 10% of dev and the increased support and maintenance burden will remain.

For now, Electron still makes sense. Coding agents are amazing. But the last mile of dev and the support surface area remains a real concern.

The state of coding agents can be summed up by this anecdote:

Claude spent $20k on an agent swarm implementing (kinda) a C-compiler in Rust, but desktop Claude is an Electron app.

Lots of lessons here. But 2 big ones:

1️⃣ It's easy to use spec driven development if you have lots of very good tests exist. They exist for C, not for the Claude app.
2️⃣ Demos and PoCs can be shipped nearly immediately. "Products" remain nuanced, hard, and slow to get right.

Looking at the recursive LM (RLM) paper this morning.

It's actually quite simple and nice idea: give the LM a REPL.

The paper is marketed as solving long-context. But I think the key nugget is to give the LM a REPL.

The REPL is useful because:
\- Execute code in it -> let's you compute things
\- Has a function to query a sub LLM (basically sub-agents)
\- Can hold arbitrary state (like new variables etc).

Also I understood the paper much better by reading the system prompt than the actual paper 😅

Interpreting and controlling internal representations should be based on how the model actually uses them!

Turns out: information geometry makes this precise. We show how, and use it to derive a (provably & empirically) robust strategy for steering.

The voice recognition market hit $18.39 billion in 2025.

By 2031, analysts project $61.71 billion.

But the number that actually matters?

87.5% of builders aren't researching voice AI anymore—they're actively shipping it.

We mapped what this shift looks like on the ground:
👉 where capital is flowing
👉 which companies are setting the pace
👉 and how voice is getting deployed across healthcare, sales, education, and customer experience

The second highest category is backoffice automation, but imo it's underrated by the AI community.

RPA is truly dead, and agentic workflows are taking its place.

A lot of backoffice work depends on routine operations over unstructured documents (invoices, claims packets, loan files). The best interface to automate these operations is enabling users to create deterministic workflows at scale, instead of solving ad-hoc tasks through chat.

We are starting to build an agentic layer within our own document processing product, LlamaCloud, that lets users "vibe-code" these workflows through natural language. Come check it out: [cloud.llamaindex.ai/](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/)

As the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research.

I have formalised the core of your Wristband Gaussian Loss in Lean to prove correctness, and it is in fact correct: the wristband map is a lossless characterization of Gaussianity. The wristband map is a true biconditional, uniform wristband output iff Gaussian input (d >= 2).

Still need a proof that the kernel identifies uniformity correctly, that would come next. You can check the repo here: [github.com/andremiguelc/wris…](https://github.com/andremiguelc/wristband-loss-proofs)

New research from Meta.

AI agents are powerful but generic.

Personalized agents are on the rise, but hard to get right.

This new research introduces PAHF (Personalized Agents from Human Feedback), a framework that teaches agents to learn and adapt to individual user preferences through continuous feedback.

Here is the idea:

Instead of static user profiles or fixed prompts, PAHF runs a three-phase loop. Pre-action clarification resolves ambiguity before acting. Grounding ties decisions to explicit per-user memory. Post-action feedback updates that memory when preferences shift.

The framework handles both cold-start users (learning fast from scratch) and preference drift (adapting when users change their minds). Two new benchmarks test exactly this, one in embodied manipulation and one in online shopping.

PAHF learns faster and consistently outperforms baseline approaches by combining explicit memory with dual feedback channels.

As agents move from demos to real deployments, personalization becomes the gap between a useful tool and one that actually fits how you work.

PAHF is a concrete step toward agents that grow with you.

Made a simple example of an LM with a REPL using mlx\_lm.server to run locally (using Qwen3 Coder Next on an M3 Ultra).

1\. Ask model to compute something (here 1000th fibonacci number).
2\. Model generates the code
3\. Run the code in the REPL
4\. Get result and return to step 2 if needed
5\. Model answers the user

This is a pretty powerful concept. Should be used with caution as it's a security risk to let an LM run arbitrary code on your machine.

deepseek v4 is coming and i feel like the discourse isn't ready

been poking around [@gmi\_cloud](https://nitter.net/gmi_cloud "GMI Cloud") lately - 16 deepseek models, fastest provider on openrouter (~42 tok/s on v3), but that's not even the interesting part. the interesting part is what's quietly happening on top of it. devs building voice agents, morning briefing bots, diagram generators, weird mini games. feels like early 2023 again where people just shipped stuff for the hell of it

got early access to something they put together that i actually liked - it's a site where you just… try a bunch of these deepseek-powered demos. no deck, no waitlist, you just go play with things. more of this please from every model launch ever

v4 is going to make a lot of closed-model pricing look silly imo. they're gathering early access people in discord rn on a waitlist - you get the demo site + free credits when it drops. leaving the links for the curious ones

New Google paper challenges how we measure LLM reasoning.

Token count is a poor proxy for actual reasoning quality.

There might be a better way to measure this.

This work introduces "deep-thinking tokens," a metric that identifies tokens where internal model predictions shift significantly across deeper layers before stabilizing.

These tokens capture "genuine reasoning" effort rather than verbose output.

Instead of measuring how much a model writes, measure how hard it's actually thinking at each step. Deep-thinking tokens are identified by tracking prediction instability across transformer layers during inference.

The ratio of deep-thinking tokens correlates more reliably with accuracy than token count or confidence metrics across mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, GPQA-diamond), tested on DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, and GPT-OSS.

They also introduce Think@n, a test-time compute strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios while early-rejecting low-quality partial outputs, reducing cost without sacrificing performance.

Why does it matter?

As inference-time scaling becomes a primary lever for improving model performance, we need better signals than token length to understand when a model is actually reasoning versus just rambling.

Researchers built Dr. CaBot, a medical AI agent trained on thousands of clinical case studies to diagnose illness, explain its reasoning, and prescribe next steps.

In tests, it provided the correct diagnosis for conditions far more often than human internists and produced explanations doctors often preferred.

What problem is Trump's new global 10% tariff meant to solve?

If it's about leverage, ask: How much leverage do you get from a tariff that disappears in 150 days?

If it's onshoring: Who builds new factories based on tariff that disappear before the factory is built?

It's a tax. That's all it is.

The worst thing about being an open source developer today is dealing with AI code pull requests. Unnecessary changes, unrelated fixes, and a bunch of code that the submitter has no idea how it works, why it is there, or what it does. I have wasted countless hours on it.
