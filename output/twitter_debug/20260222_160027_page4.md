While everyone is debating usefulness of Openclaw, I think we have seen what “agentic future” might have in-store for us.

As I keep adding “skills” — my own, no third party skill allowed — I can’t help but notice. The “connector” interface has been solved. Basically stitching API providers and ensure robust interaction within harness.

The next phase, in which , multi system interactions are mutating into “just md files lol” is ……. comfortable. You want to scrape Twitter without API ? Fine just add a skill. You want to find a trade in Gold/Silver ? Fine just add a skill.

The “fine just add a skill” iteration is 10x faster than prior “connector” phase. Pretty sure the next phase , which we can already see some glimpse of, is self mutating layer.

We are not ready for this. We never were.

for typical real/messy tasks, verification difficulty scales with task difficulty (IMHO)
so: "an X% time horizon of N hours," with fixed X but growing N, means it takes more and more user time to determine whether the system landed in the lucky X% or the unlucky (100-X)% 🙃

2026 ai bubble is peaking itself right now: someone just dropped a new benchmark on claude skills and the result of their paper is actually insane

the paper explicitly states smaller models with skills beat larger models without them

a smaller model like claude 4.5 haiku equipped with high quality skills smokes a raw state of the art opus 4.5 model by about 6 percent (27.7 vs 22.0)

imagine getting sota level performance from a free model, its basically cheating, you just have to manually spoonfeed it a basic markdown file explaining how to do its job

all of you opus guys are dumb, you can literally spam haiku with skills and get things shipped in 5x lesser time and 0 cost

even wilder thing is that codex gpt 5.2 fails on the pareto frontier. codex burned massive compute and costs, just to get completely mogged by gemini 3 flash hitting maximum performance at a fraction of cash

i can believe skill engineering is now a valid, mathematically proven substitute for compute

over that, it says self generated skills provide zero benefit on average and show negative deltas on 16/84 tasks. if you give an agent more than 3 skills at once, it bloats its context and completely fails

Apple has just published a paper with a devastating title: \*The Illusion of Thinking\*. And it's not a metaphor. What it demonstrates is that the AI models we use every day - yes, ones like ChatGPT - don't think. Not one bit. They just imitate doing so.

Software is about to go through the same transition that stock trading did when algorithmic traders entered the market.

AI will not be good for bootstrappers. They will be wrecked like retail traders were.

There used to be many crevices of the market that large software companies couldn’t reach.

Bootstrappers and small caps built nests there.

But with AI, large software companies will start to look like multi-vertical hedge funds.

With 1000 AI tentacles, they will suck the alpha out of every crevice.

While one crevice may not have been appetizing enough to go after before, 1000 will be.

Software will begin to have something like “market makers” who make money on everything.

A small number of hedgefund-like software companies may come to own everything.

Cursor CEO Michael Truell: Programming in the future might not mean programming with an AI helper, but in a new language entirely.

"There is a future version of the world where the way you interact with AI is a little bit less like it's a human helper that you're delegating work to... and instead, it's a little bit more of an advance in compiler or interpreter technology."

"It can lead you to a world where programming languages actually change. They can start to be a little bit more about what you want and a little bit less about how you do it."

"There is a world where direct manipulation of the UI starts to play a little bit more into it."

Many people seem to experience the humanity of others more strongly than me, but I still have a sense. When I hear commentary that reduces humanity to nothingness, it feels “wrong”, like objectively incorrect. 3/

It’s a full upgrade across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design.

It also features a 1M token context window in beta.

I've come to realize that the Meta Manus acquisition marks the beginning of the end of the media buyer as we've known it for the past decade and a half....

Media buyers will be doing work that really has nothing to do with buying media and will fully evolve to become full stack growth strategists.

In some ways it's been a slow burn with more automation than ever in the last 36 months, but I truly believe this is the inflection where we see an exponential removal of the human touch on traditional media buying work.

This is a good thing, humans should be doing higher leverage tasks than than toggling switches and budgets all day.

Bytedance just dropped a paper that might change how AI thinks.

Literally.

They figured out why LLMs fail at long reasoning — and framed it as chemistry.

The discovery:

Chain-of-thought isn't just words. It's molecular structure.

Three bond types:

• Deep reasoning = covalent bonds (strong, unbreakable)
• Self-reflection = hydrogen bonds (flexible, context-aware)
• Exploration = van der Waals (weak, ever-present)
Why most AI "thinking" sucks:

Everyone's been imitating keywords — "wait," "let me check" — without building the actual bonds.

It's like copying the shape of a protein without the atomic forces holding it together.

Bytedance proved: structure emerges from training, not prompting.

The fix: Mole-Syn

Their method doesn't just generate text. It synthesizes stable thought molecules.

Results: better reasoning, more stable RL training.

Bytedance is treating AI reasoning like organic chemistry — and it works.

nano harness is a code first agent harness in 223 lines of code. it's rough, ready, and very hackable.

Building great AI products requires excellence in both creativity and technical execution. You need to create the right culture and enough space for good ideas to emerge and grow naturally, then fuel the best ideas with strong execution.

The reason you see most good products start out as personal projects is because we are most in tune with matters when building for ourselves. Products that are built for a fictitious user almost always end up bad because you don’t get a good handle on what actually matters and you build things that don’t resonate with users. It’s not that different from creating great art.

Looking at the recursive LM (RLM) paper this morning.

It's actually quite simple and nice idea: give the LM a REPL.

The paper is marketed as solving long-context. But I think the key nugget is to give the LM a REPL.

The REPL is useful because:
\- Execute code in it -> let's you compute things
\- Has a function to query a sub LLM (basically sub-agents)
\- Can hold arbitrary state (like new variables etc).

Also I understood the paper much better by reading the system prompt than the actual paper 😅

Some replies along the lines of the key idea is breaking down the prompt and recursively running sub LLMs on it and stitching them back together.

I understand that’s the central premise of the paper. But the lasting nugget is giving the LLM a REPL (which may not even be novel in this paper).

Prescriptive recipes for how to do something will almost certainly not make sense in the near future, maybe even in the next generation of LLMs. They will be washed away in the tide of increasing LLM capabilities.

Sent this message to a bunch of college friends with varying exposure to AI:

I've had a big shift in my perspective on AI over the past two years that I've mostly neglected to communicate to people, partially because it's been happening slowly in the background. I used to think that it was pretty plausible we'd hit a wall this decade with respect to some fundamental capability, but this has slowly been getting less likely to me as AI progress has continued, and now this seems very unlikely to me (<5%).

Previous technologies have never fully substituted for human labor—they've always been complementary. The fundamental reason for this is that previous technologies haven't been intelligent agents—they're merely tools that require intelligent agents to use them. I thought for many years that this could still turn out to be the case with the current paradigm of AI, but there's just been too much progress, and it's happening too rapidly, for this to seem plausible anymore.

What does this change in perspective mean concretely? I'm now quite confident that within the next 2-30 years, the economy and civilization will look totally, radically different from how it's operated for the past 2500 years. I still have a lot of uncertainty about what exactly this will look like—whether it'll be utopic, dystopic, maybe somewhere in between, or maybe we'll all be dead. But I feel very confident now that it's going to be totally insane and chaotic (like, many orders of magnitude more chaotic than anything the world has experienced in our lifetimes, like way way more significant than Covid, to pick a recent example).

I don't have a really concrete goal with sending this except that you're my best friends and it feels important for me to say my true beliefs to y'all. I guess I don't want you to be caught off guard. There are maybe two concrete takeaways/pieces of advice I feel comfortable giving: try to develop strong wellsprings of meaning and purpose from things outside of work (I think most of us are fine on this point), and start thinking about political actions you could take that feel true to you, that could plausibly help us muddle through the transition.

Cool concept but slight issue: ~99.9% of the training data was written after 1911, so you'd basically need to train the model on... almost nothing.

And good luck surgically removing all knowledge of general relativity when half of modern physics, GPS explanations, and sci-fi plots are built on it.

The real Einstein test is whether you can even build that dataset 😅

Demis Hassabis’s “Einstein test” for defining AGI:

Train a model on all human knowledge but cut it off at 1911, then see if it can independently discover general relativity (as Einstein did by 1915);

if yes, it’s AGI.

you can feel this viscerally when you are few turns down in the conversation in claude code or codex and the model just answers without thinking or exploring more when it should. in such cases, i generally have to give more instructions to the model...

that's fair but it's also standard. OAI asks for user id hints for this reason so it can route request to the same cluster. no route = no cache. very very common skill issue

bruh, I wanted to write a simple „yeah open models are somewhat behind closed models but not as much as some benches show“ and now kimi k2.5 is running circles around the closed models

Arcee Trinity Large Technical Report

Author's Explanation:
[nitter.net/arcee\_ai/status/201627…](https://nitter.net/arcee_ai/status/2016278017572495505?s=20)

Overview:
The Arcee Trinity series consists of sparse Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, with a 400B parameter model that activates 13B parameters per token.

The architecture uses interleaved local and global attention, depth-scaled sandwich normalization, and a novel load balancing strategy called Soft-clamped Momentum Expert Bias Updates (SMEBU).

Training utilized the Muon optimizer over 17 trillion tokens, achieving stable convergence with zero loss spikes across all scales.

I think about this a lot these days.

It used to be a common trope of HN comments where people would make claims about how easily they could clone Twitter, etc, completely missing where the real costs and challenges lie.

Cloning any random piece of SaaS is something that could already be done before agentic coding, and the economics of it haven't changed meaningfully. Before, writing the clone would cost 0.5-1% of the valuation of the legacy SaaS company. Now it might be 0.1%. It doesn't make a difference -- if you can pull it off profitably today you could also have done it profitably in the past.

The code is a very small part of the process of making such a clone successful, and the reason legacy software has often bad UX is not because code was expensive to write.

I loathe to make the slippery slope argument but they're not going to stop at requiring you to monitor your 3D printer so you don't print guns.

If they can claim simply because something is in computer code that is not considered free speech, then your PC is prime real estate for the government to spy on.

This is like asking word processors to report everything back to the government so that they can make sure you're not writing something illegal.

"But I don't do illegal things," I hear you say. Not yet you don't. That day is coming.

Last I checked, Twitter is still around, despite having been cloned 10,000 times before. And IMO most legacy SaaS has even greater stickiness than a social network (which does have tremendous stickiness)

Google uses Workday. Huge contract. You think Google, the software company most prone to rolling out internal tools for any random employee task, couldn't make its own Workday for all these years because the \*code\* was too expensive to write? It would have been 1 week for 1 Google dev top

United States Colorado Sen. Matt Ball and Rep. Amy Paschal have authored bill SB26-051.

SB26-051 would require Operating System, such as Windows or Linux, to perform age verification on users which then third party apps can leverage via API to ensure someone's age.
