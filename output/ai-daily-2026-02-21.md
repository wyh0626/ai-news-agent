### 1. LoopViT: Tiny AI Outthinks Bigger Models with Looped Transformers

A collaboration between HKUST, CASIA, and UC Santa Cruz introduces LoopViT, a looped transformer that reuses a small set of weights to simulate an internal chain of thought. The 18M-parameter model stops computing when predictions become certain and achieves 65.8% on the ARC-AGI visual reasoning benchmark, outperforming a larger 73M-parameter model on the same task. The paper is available on arXiv and code on GitHub. [Source-twitter](https://x.com/jiqizhixin/status/2025414242011382041)

### 2. Llama 3.1 70B Runs on RTX 3090 via NVMe-GPU Bypass

A Show HN demonstrates that Llama 3.1 70B can run on a single RTX 3090 by bypassing CPU and RAM with an NVMe-to-GPU setup. The project links a library (ntransformer) and reports it works on consumer GPUs, with better performance expected on professional GPUs. It highlights a hardware-focused approach to running large transformers outside traditional CPU-based memory paths. [Source-hackernews](https://github.com/xaskasdf/ntransformer)

### 3. CPU-trained 29.7M LLM beats GPU baseline in 40 hours

FlashLM v5 'Thunderbolt' trains on CPU (AMD Ryzen 7950X3D) for about 40 hours, achieving perplexity 1.36 and BPC 0.44 with 29.7M parameters. It beats the TinyStories-1M baseline (PPL 1.59), marking the first CPU-trained model to surpass that benchmark. The model uses a MatMul-free architecture called ParallelGatedRecurrence with ternary BitLinear weights; arki05 provided the CPU hardware.
