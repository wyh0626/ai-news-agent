### 1. Aristotle Launches Research AI
Aristotle is now live, designed to enable AI to work in the way scientists think, featuring self-questioning reasoning and an epistemological graph exploration, and to support and verify bold hypotheses after generating results. This design is expected to improve the transparency and verification efficiency of scientific reasoning, and will be freely accessible to researchers validated in the United States.

### 2. Llama3-8B Chip Becomes a Model
Reportedly, Taalas can perform inference for Llama 3 8B at about 16k tokens per second; compared with SRAM systems like Cerebras, performance is near an order of magnitude higher. The core idea is that each chip corresponds to a single model; the chip is the model, greatly reducing model-switching overhead. The chat functionality in the demonstration was described as extremely impressive. [Source-x](https://x.com/awnihannun/status/2024671348782711153)

### 3. Sonnet-4.6 Tops in Evaluations
According to a tweet, Sonnet-4.6 won in multiple evaluations including EQ-Bench, creative writing, long-form writing, and Judgemark; Opus 4.6 is on par within the margin of error, with GLM-5 and Qwen3.5-397B following closely. [Source-x](https://x.com/sam_paech/status/2024235770022904111)
