### 1. Taalas Real-World Benchmark: Llama3-8B at 16k Tokens per Second
Background is to boost inference throughput in edge/conversation scenarios. Taalas proposes an architecture where a chip is dedicated to a single model, increasing inference speed to 16k tokens per second per user, nearly ten times faster than SRAM systems like Cerebras. The core idea is “the chip is the model,” significantly reducing latency and cost. This could influence or enable new commercialization paths for edge intelligence and low-power dialogue systems.

### 2. MonarchRT Real-time Video Inference
MonarchRT accelerates end-to-end video inference by parameterizing attention-mapping into tiled Monarch matrices. Official claims real-time 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090, and about 1.5–12x performance improvement over FA 2/3/4 on RTX 5090, H100, and B200. This approach is significant for real-time video generation, surveillance, and simulation scenarios, and it is open-source. [Source-x](https://x.com/InfiniAILab/status/2023928541293728105)

### 3. First Generative Media Report Released
The first Generative Media Report surveys the past year’s progress, covering models, enterprise adoption and use cases, developer trends, and projections for 2026 across image, video, audio, 3D modalities. The report provides an authoritative reference for the industry, helping enterprises steer investments and R&D directions and promote standardized development. It is a valuable reference for decisions by media, content creation, and platform operators. [Source-x](https://x.com/fal/status/2024529735049507166)
